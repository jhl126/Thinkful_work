SteadyMed Ltd., together with its subsidiaries, operates as a specialty pharmaceutical company that focuses on the development and commercialization of drug product candidates for the treatment of orphan and other diseases with unmet parenteral delivery needs. The company's product candidates are enabled by its proprietary PatchPump, a discreet, pre-filled, water-resistant, and disposable parenteral drug administration technology. Its lead drug product candidate is Trevyent, a development stage drug that combines PatchPump technology with treprostinil, a vasodilatory prostacyclin analogue for treating pulmonary arterial hypertension. It also develops two drug product candidates for the treatment of post-surgical and acute pain in the home setting, including ketorolac PatchPump for short-term management of moderately severe acute pain; and bupivacaine PatchPump for use in local anesthesia post-surgery. SteadyMed Ltd. was founded in 2005 and is headquartered in San Ramon, California.
