Egalet Corporation, a specialty pharmaceutical company, develops, manufactures, and commercializes treatments for patients with pain and other conditions. It has licensed three approved pain products, such as SPRIX Nasal Spray, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug indicated in adult patients for the short-term management of moderate to moderately severe pain that requires analgesia at the opioid level; OXAYDO, an immediate-release oxycodone product designed to discourage abuse via snorting for the management of acute and chronic moderate to severe pain where an opioid is appropriate; and ARYMO ER, an extended-release (ER) morphine product formulated with abuse-deterrent (AD) properties for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate. The company is also developing Egalet-002, a Guardian Technology AD, ER, oral oxycodone formulation, which is in Phase III clinical trials for the same indication as ARYMO ER. In addition, its other products include Egalet-003, an AD stimulant product candidate; and Egalet-004, an AD, ER hydrocodone-based product candidate. The company has a collaboration and license agreement with Acura Pharmaceuticals, Inc. to commercialize OXAYDO tablets; and Septodont, Inc. to promote SPRIX Nasal Spray. Egalet Corporation was founded in 2010 and is headquartered in Wayne, Pennsylvania.
