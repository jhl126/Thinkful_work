RXi Pharmaceuticals Corporation, a clinical-stage company, focuses on developing therapeutics for unmet medical needs. It develops therapies based on its self-delivering RNAi (sd-rxRNA) platform; and Samcyprone topical immunomodulatory. The company's clinical development programs include RXI-109, an sd-rxRNA compound, which is in Phase II clinical trial for preventing or reducing dermal scarring following scar revision surgery of an existing hypertrophic scar; and in Phase I/II clinical trial for treating retinal scarring, as well as in discovery stage for the treatment of corneal scarring. Its clinical development programs also comprise RXI-231, an sd-rxRNA compound targeting tyrosinase, which is in development stage as a cosmetic ingredient for treating uneven skin tone and pigmentation; and RXI-185, an sd-rxRNA compound targeting collagenase that is in development stage as a cosmetic ingredient for treating wrinkles and skin laxity. The company is also developing Samcyprone, a formulation of the small molecule diphenylcyclopropenone, which is in Phase IIa clinical trial for the clearance of common warts. In addition, it is developing cell-based cancer immunotherapies. RXi Pharmaceuticals Corporation has collaborative research agreements with Gustave Roussy to evaluate the potential of the company's sd-rxRNA technology platform for use in cancer treatments; and Medigene AG to explore potential synergies of using RNAi technology in combination with Medigene's recombinant TCRs to develop modified T cells. The company was incorporated in 2011 and is headquartered in Marlborough, Massachusetts.
