OncoSec Medical Incorporated, a biotechnology company, engages in developing DNA-based intratumoral immunotherapies in the United States. The company's investigational technology, ImmunoPulseis designed to enhance the local delivery and uptake of DNA-based immune-targeting agents, such as plasmid encoded IL-12 (tavokinogene telseplasmid or tavo) for the treatment of cancer. Its lead product candidate, ImmunoPulse IL-12, has demonstrated a favorable safety profile, evidence of anti-tumor activity in the treatment of various solid tumors, and the potential to reach beyond the site of local treatment to initiate a systemic immune response in Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials for metastatic melanoma and triple-negative breast cancer. The company has also completed Phase II studies in metastatic melanoma (OMS-I100) and merkel cell carcinoma (OMS-I110). OncoSec Medical Incorporated has an investigator-sponsored clinical trial with the University of California, San Francisco to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ImmunoPulse IL-12 in combination with KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) in patients with low tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (OMS-I102); and a clinical trial collaboration and drug supply agreement with Merck (known as MSD outside the United States and Canada) to evaluate the combination of its ImmuoPulse IL-12 with Merck's anti-PD-1 therapy KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) in a registration-directed Phase 2b clinical trial referred to as PISCES. This trial would evaluate the combination of therapies in patients with unresectable metastatic melanoma who have progressed. It also has a research collaboration with Avacta Group plc for gene delivery of therapeutic affimers. The company was formerly known as NetVentory Solutions Inc. and changed its name to OncoSec Medical Incorporated in March 2011. OncoSec Medical Incorporated was incorporated in 2008 and is headquartered in San Diego, California.
