CyberOptics Corporation develops and manufactures high precision sensing technology solutions worldwide. Its sensors are being used in surface mount technology (SMT), semiconductor, and metrology markets to improve yields and productivity. The company offers multi-reflection suppression sensors for application in the SMT, semiconductor, and metrology markets; and strobe inspection modules for use in 2D automated optical inspection (AOI) systems. It also provides SMT electronic assembly alignment sensor products, including LaserAlign sensors for incorporation into pick-and-place machines; and InPrinter Inspection Camera, which identifies fiducial markings on a circuit board to ensure accurate board registration prior to placement of solder paste. In addition, the company offers 3D solder paste inspection sensors; inspection system products primarily used in the semiconductor and SMT electronic assembly industries for process control, inspection, and metrology; AOI products to inspect circuit boards after component placement; and 3D solder paste measurement machines. Further, it provides metrology products, such as CyberGage 360 and SQ3000 3D CMM, which are used as in-line or off-line metrology tools in the SMT, semiconductor, and consumer electronics manufacturing industries; and WaferSense family of products that provide measurements of critical factors in the semiconductor fabrication process. The company sells its products to the electronic assembly circuit board manufacturers, including end-user customers manufacturing their own circuit boards, original design manufacturers, electronics manufacturing service providers, and outsourced semiconductor assembly and test companies; and semiconductor DRAM and SSD memory manufacturers through independent sales representatives and distributors. CyberOptics Corporation was founded in 1984 and is headquartered in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
