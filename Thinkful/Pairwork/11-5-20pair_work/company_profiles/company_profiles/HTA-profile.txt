Healthcare Trust of America, Inc. (NYSE: HTA) is the largest dedicated owner and operator of medical office buildings ("MOBs") in the United States based on gross leasable area ("GLA"). We provide the real estate infrastructure for the integrated delivery of healthcare services in highly desirable locations. Over the last decade, we have invested $7.0 billion primarily in MOBs and other healthcare assets comprising 24.1 million square feet of GLA. Our investments are targeted in 20 to 25 key markets that we believe have superior healthcare demographics that support strong, long-term demand for medical office space. We have achieved, and continue to achieve, critical mass within these key markets by expanding our presence through accretive acquisitions, and utilizing our in-house operating expertise through our regionally located property management and leasing platform. Headquartered in Scottsdale, Arizona and directed from our full-time service offices, HTA has developed a national brand with dedicated relationships at the local level. We have achieved scale in 16 markets with greater than 500,000 square feet and 10 markets with approximately 1 million or greater square feet; in each market we service our healthcare providers through our institutional full-service operational platform including property management, leasing and development services. This drives efficiencies, strong tenant and health system relationships, and strategic partnerships that result in high levels of tenant retention, rental growth, and long-term value creation across the portfolio. Founded in 2006 and listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 2012, HTA has produced attractive returns for its stockholders that we believe have significantly outperformed the S&P 500 and US REIT indices.
