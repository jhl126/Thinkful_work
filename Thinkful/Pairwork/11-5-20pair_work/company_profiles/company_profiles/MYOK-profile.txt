MyoKardia, Inc., a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company, discovers, develops, and commercializes therapies for the treatment of rare cardiovascular diseases. Its lead product candidate is mavacamten, an orally administered small molecule, which has completed Phase II clinical trial that is designed to reduce left ventricular contractility to potentially alleviate the functional consequences and symptoms of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and prevent or reverse HCM progression. The company also develops MYK-491, an orally-administered small molecule, which is in Phase I b clinical trial that is designed to restore normal contractility in the diseased dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) heart. Its three preclinical programs include HCM-2 that is used to reduce cardiac muscle contractility to normal levels in HCM patients; DCM-2, which is used to enhance cardiac muscle contractility to normal levels in genetic DCM patients; and LUS-1 that is used to counteract a muscle disruption that results in impaired relaxation of the heart, a biomechanical defect found in specific HCM and genetic DCM patient subgroups, as well as in other less common heritable cardiomyopathies. The company has a strategic collaboration with Aventis Inc. for the research, development, and commercialization of pharmaceutical products to treat, prevent, and diagnose HCM and DCM, as well as additional indications. MyoKardia, Inc. was founded in 2012 and is headquartered in South San Francisco, California.
