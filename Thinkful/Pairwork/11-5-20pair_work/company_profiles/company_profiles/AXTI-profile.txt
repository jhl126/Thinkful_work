AXT, Inc. designs, develops, manufactures, and distributes compound and single element semiconductor substrates. It manufactures semiconductor substrates using its proprietary vertical gradient freeze technology. The company offers indium phosphide (InP) for use in fiber optic lasers and detectors, passive optical networks, data center connectivity, silicon photonics, photonic integrated circuits, terrestrial solar cells, lasers, military wireless RF amplifiers, infrared motion control, and infrared thermal imaging products. It also provides semi-insulating gallium with arsenic (GaAs) substrates, which are used for application in power amplifiers for wireless devices, and transistors and solar cells for drones. In addition, the company offers semi-conducting GaAs substrates that are used in opto-electronic products, including high brightness light emitting diodes in backlight wireless handsets and liquid crystal display televisions, as well as for automotive panel, signage, display, and lighting applications; and 3-D sensing using vertical cavity surface emitting lasers. Further, it provides germanium (Ge) substrates for space and terrestrial photovoltaic applications, as well as optical applications. Additionally, the company, through its subsidiaries and joint ventures, manufactures and sells raw materials, such as gallium, gallium alloys, InP poly-crystal, arsenic, Ge, Ge dioxide, high purity arsenic, pyrolytic boron nitride crucibles, and boron oxide. It sells its products through direct sales force in the United States, China, and Europe, as well as through independent sales representatives and distributors in Japan, Taiwan, Korea, and internationally. The company was formerly known as American Xtal Technology, Inc. and changed its name to AXT, Inc. in July 2000. AXT, Inc. was founded in 1986 and is headquartered in Fremont, California.
