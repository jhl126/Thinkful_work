Xerium Technologies, Inc. provides industrial consumable products and services. It operates through two segments, Machine Clothing and Roll Covers. The Machine Clothing segment provides various types of industrial textiles used on paper-making machines and other industrial applications. It manufactures forming fabrics that are used at the beginning of paper-making machines; press felts for carrying the paper sheet through a series of press rolls that mechanically press water from the sheet under high pressure; and dryer fabrics that transport the paper sheet through the drying section of paper-making machines. This segment also provides other fabrics, which are used in other industrial applications, such as pulp, non-woven textiles, fiber cement, tannery sludge dewatering, and textiles manufacturing; and machine clothing products. The Roll Covers segment manufactures, refurbishes, and replaces roll covers, including suction rolls, lump breaker rolls, coater rolls, sizing rolls, calendar rolls, and conveying rolls used in paper-making machines. This segment also provides refurbishment services for previously installed roll covers; and mechanical maintenance and repair services for the internal mechanisms of rolls. It markets its products to the paper industry worldwide through its direct sales force under the Huyck Wangner, Weavexx, Stowe Woodward, Mount Hope, Robec, IRGA, Xibe/Stowe, JJ Plank, and Spencer Johnston brands. The company was founded in 1999 and is headquartered in Youngsville, North Carolina.
