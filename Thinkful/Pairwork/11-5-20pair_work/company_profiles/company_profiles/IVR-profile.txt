Invesco Mortgage Capital Inc. operates as a real estate investment trust (REIT) that focuses on investing in, financing, and managing residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities and mortgage loans. It invests in residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) that are guaranteed by the U.S. government agency or a federally chartered corporation; RMBS that are not issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government agency; commercial mortgage-backed securities; residential and commercial mortgage loans; and other real estate-related financing arrangements. The company has elected to be taxed as a REIT. As a result, it would not be subject to federal corporate income taxes if it distributes at least 90% of its taxable income to its stockholders. Invesco Mortgage Capital Inc. was founded in 2008 and is headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia.
