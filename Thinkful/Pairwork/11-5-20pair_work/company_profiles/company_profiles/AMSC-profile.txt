American Superconductor Corporation provides megawatt-scale solutions worldwide. The company operates through two segments, Wind and Grid. The Wind segment designs wind turbine systems and licenses these designs to third parties under the Windtec Solutions brand. It supplies power electronics and software-based control systems, and provides customer support services to wind turbine manufacturers. This segment's design portfolio comprises a range of drivetrains and power ratings of 2 megawatts. The Grid segment offers products and services that enable electric utilities and renewable energy project developers to connect, transmit, and distribute power under the Gridtec Solutions brand. It provides transmission planning services, which identify power grid congestion, poor power quality, and other risks; grid interconnection solutions for wind farms and solar power plants, power quality systems, and transmission and distribution cable systems; resilient electric grid systems, which provide protection against the adverse effects that follow the loss of critical substation facilities in urban areas; and ship protection systems, which reduce a naval ship's magnetic signature. This segment also offers flexible alternating current transmission system, a system that consists of power electronics and other static components used for controlling power flow and voltage in the AC transmission system; and standalone fault current limiters, which act as surge protectors for the power grid. American Superconductor Corporation was founded in 1987 and is headquartered in Devens, Massachusetts.
