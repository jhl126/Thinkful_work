Advanced Emissions Solutions, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, provides emission reduction technologies and associated specialty chemicals in the United States. It operates through two segments, Refined Coal and Emissions Control. The company offers M-Prove technology that provides an alternative to other halogen-based and oxidation chemicals used to enhance removal of mercury emissions; and RESPond liquid chemical additive, an ash resistivity modifier for power plants operating cold-side electrostatic precipitators. It also offers CyClean technology, a pre-combustion coal treatment process to enhance combustion, as well as to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxide and mercury from coals burned in cyclone boilers; and M-45 and M-45-PC technologies, which are pre-combustion coal treatment technologies used to control emissions from circulating fluidized bed boilers and pulverized coal boilers. In addition, the company provides Activated Carbon Injection (ACI) systems to reduce mercury emissions over a range of plant configurations and coal types; Dry Sorbent Injection (DSI) systems to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide and other acid gases, such as sulfur trioxide and hydrogen chloride; and ADAir Mixer in-duct technology that alters flue gas flow to enhance mixing and optimize particle dispersion to reduce sorbent consumption for ACI and DSI systems. Further, it offers general consulting services related to emissions control. The company serves customers in the coal-fired power generation and industrial boiler processes. Advanced Emissions Solutions, Inc. was founded in 1996 and is headquartered in Highlands Ranch, Colorado.
