Intense and tradition-rich rivalries are fun no matter the stakes. They get even juicer when both teams are ranked. This year rivalry week includes five matchups of teams ranked in the latest AP Top 25 presented by Regions Bank, though one of them is Cincinnati at Memphis, which is definitely a big game in the American Athletic Conference, but doesn't really qualify as a big rivalry. In the latest AP Top 25 presented by Region. Here are the ones that do (rivalry records, according to Sports-Reference.com):. 2 Ohio State at No. The Game has been a lot more interesting since coach Jim Harbaugh's arrival at Michigan five years ago, even though he has not won one yet. This is the fourth time the Buckeyes and Wolverines are both ranked. Only once in the seven years pre-Harbaugh were both ranked. Ohio State is 21-20-4 when both teams are ranked, including seven straight victories. The Buckeyes are 11-9-2 when both are in the top 10, including the last three. 5 Alabama at No. The Iron Bowl will match ranked team for the third time in the last four years and fifth time in the last seven. Auburn leads the series 13-9 when both are ranked, including 3-2 since Nick Saban has been at Alabama. 7 Oklahoma at No. 21 Oklahoma State. This is the best era of Bedlam.

The Badgers are 6-0 when both teams are ranked. 1 LSU (11-0). Next: vs. Texas A&M. Reality check: The Tigers are the first team in SEC history with a 4,000-yard passer (Joe Burrow), a 100-yard rusher (Clyde Edwards-Helaire) and two 1,000-yard receivers (J'Marr Chase and Justin Jefferson). Ranked: Just right. 2 Ohio State (11-0). Next: at No. Reality check: Hard to find flaws on these Buckeyes, but here's one: 25 sacks allowed ranks 83rd in the nation. And that's with an offense that has thrown only 301 passes, 102nd in the nation. QB Justin Fields needs to embrace the throwaway. Ranked: Just right, but the gap between 1 and 2 is getting smaller. 3 Clemson (11-0). Next: at South Carolina. Reality check: The Tigers might have their best offensive line of the Dabo Swinney era, with four seniors and sophomore left tackle Jackson Carman, a former five-star developing into an All-American. Ranked: Just right. 4 Georgia (10-1). Next: at Georgia Tech. Reality check: There is a theory the Bulldogs could be better offensively if coach Kirby Smart simply unleashed his talented team. Reality check is skeptical about just how much more power is underneath that hood. Ranked: Feels too high, but who else should be four. 5 Alabama (10-1). Next: at No. Realty check: RB Najee Harris has three straight games with a touchdown rushing and receiving. Will he take on a big role with QB Mac Jones starting against Auburn.

Ranked: Just right. 8 Florida (9-2). Next: vs. Florida State. Reality check: The Gators are converting 39.53% on third down, worst among top-10 teams and 71st in the nation. Ranked: Too high. 9 Minnesota (10-1). Next: vs. No. Reality check: The Gophers are fourth in the nation in third-down conversions at 51.88%. Ranked: Too low. 10 Michigan (9-2). Next: vs. No. 2 Ohio State. Reality check: Shea Patterson has consecutive 300-yard passing games. The last Michigan quarterback to do that was Jake Ruddock in 2015, Harbaugh's first season. Ranked: The Wolverines are rolling, but this is too high. 11 Baylor (10-1). Next: at Kansas. Reality check: The Bears' defense has a tough time getting off the field, allowing opponents to convert 41.18% on third down, worst among ranked teams. Ranked: Just right. 12 Penn State (9-2). Next: vs. Rutgers. Reality check: The Nittany Lions managed to avoid getting embarrassed by the Buckeyes, playing most of the second half with a backup quarterback. That's probably worth staying ahead of a Michigan team they beat. Ranked: Too low. 13 Wisconsin (9-2). Next: at No. Reality check: The Badgers are sixth in third-down conversions (51.70%) and first in third-down defense (24.64%).

Reality check: The Tigers have scored at least 42 points in five straight games. Ranked: Just right. 18 Cincinnati (10-1). Next: at No. 17 Memphis, Friday.

Reality check: The Broncos will be making their third straight Mountain West championship game appearance, despite having played four of their last five games without starting BQ Hack Bachmeier. Ranked: About right. 21 Oklahoma State (8-3). Next: vs. No. Reality check: Injuries have stripped the Cowboys of star receiver Tylan Wallace and QB Spencer Sanders.
