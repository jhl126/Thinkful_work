LEBANON, N.H. (AP) â€” Dartmouth-Hitchcock Health has launched a new education campaign in New Hampshire and Vermont about the dangers of vaping. The "No Safe Vape" effort includes a website that presents facts about vaping and a list of local, regional and national resources for those seeking further information or help quitting. An advertising campaign is planned, and the health system also hosted a Facebook Live event with experts and teens. Dr. Susanne Tanski, a Dartmouth-Hitchcock pediatrician, also briefed members of the U.S. Senate last week about the hazards of vaping. As electronic cigarette use by teenagers has surged, health advocates are encouraging President Donald Trump to move forward with a federal ban on thousands of flavors used in vaping products.
