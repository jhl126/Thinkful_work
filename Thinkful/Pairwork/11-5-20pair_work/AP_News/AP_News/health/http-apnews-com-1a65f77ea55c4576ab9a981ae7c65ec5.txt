ARLINGTON, Neb. (AP) — Classes in Arlington, about 35 miles northwest of Omaha, have been cancelled because of a suspected outbreak of norovirus. The Omaha World-Herald reports that the decision saw classes for the district's more than 600 students in kindergarten through 12th grade canceled on Friday. Classes are set to resume Monday, after school buildings are deep-cleaned and sanitized over the weekend. School officials made the decision to cancel classes after 112 students — most of them in elementary school — became ill. Norovirus is a highly contagious bug that causes diarrhea, vomiting and other symptoms and can spread quickly in public places. The news came after the Grand Junction school district in western Colorado announced it was shutting down through Thanksgiving week because of a norovirus outbreak.
