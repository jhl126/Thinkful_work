SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) â€” A fifth Illinois resident has died after being hospitalized with a vaping-related lung injury. The Illinois Department of Public Health on Thursday did not release any information about the victim, nor when or where the death occurred. According to the department, 187 people in Illinois, ranging from 13 years to 75 years old have experienced lung injuries after e-cigarette use. Public Health director Dr. Ngozi Ezike says it is important that people not use e-cigarettes or vaping products containing tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). The highest risk for lung injury associated with the use of e-cigarettes appears to be among those who use THC containing products. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says as of Nov. 20, there have been 2,290 reported cases of lung injuries resulting from e-cigarette use nationwide, with 47 deaths.
