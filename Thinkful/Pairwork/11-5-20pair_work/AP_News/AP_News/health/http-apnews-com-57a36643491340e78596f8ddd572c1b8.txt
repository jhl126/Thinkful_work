LONGVIEW, Wash. (AP) â€” Vape shop owners in Washington state have raised concerns that a statewide ban on flavored vaping products resulted in a loss of business for most companies. Longview Daily News reports that two Cowlitz County stores are changing the way they do business to avoid closing down including replacing vaping products with cannabidiol health and beauty products. Longview and Kelso Viper Vapor stores manager Marshall Brock says they had two options to close or rebrand after the 120-day state ban was enacted Oct. 9. Brock says he chose the latter to survive. Vape D Lish owner Allan Kettle estimates a third of vapor-only stores have closed. Kettle says one of his stores is scheduled to close Saturday. State officials say the ban is intended to combat an increase in vaping-related illness. Information from: The Daily News, http://www.tdn.com.
