WICHITA, Kan. (AP) â€” A tiger that had been in declining health has died at a Wichita zoo. Jennica King, of the Sedgwick County Zoo, said the 14-year-old Amur tiger named Talali had not been on exhibit for several months. The Wichita Eagle reports that zookeepers had discovered a mass on her body and had been monitoring it, but her health quickly worsened. King said that on Sunday, Talali began having trouble moving around in her stall and seemed confused. They decided to euthanize her that morning. She had been part of the zoo's Slawson Family Tiger Trek exhibit since it opened in 2009. Information from: The Wichita (Kan.) Eagle, http://www.kansas.com.
