WASHINGTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jul 26, 2019--. A who's who of highly respected military and civilian information technology executives from the Dept. of Defense and throughout the U.S. government today released a detailed report in cooperation with the IT Acquisition Advisory Council (IT-AAC), calling out the troubled Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) proposal for diverging in most key areas from DoD's highly regarded Cloud Strategy. While the executives and former military officers are strong proponents of the new DoD Cloud Strategy adopted in December 2018, today's report laid out six critical ways in which the JEDI proposal either ignores or specifically diverges from the Cloud Strategy and calls for JEDI to be rescinded and revised. The report is posted at www.IT-AAC.org. The military IT experts and CIOs are:. They jointly drafted and signed this letter accompanying the report to the Acting Secretary and CIO of the Defense Dept., Congressional Armed Services committees and the White House. "Where the JEDI RFP stipulates a single, static cloud solution, the DoD Cloud Strategy outlines a rich environment including multiple cloud solutions. The Cloud Strategy demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of the security challenges facing DoD that is absent from the JEDI RFP," the report points out. Additionally, the report pointed out that: "The Strategy recognizes the central role that Software as a Service (SaaS) will play in the DoD IT ecosystem, yet SaaS is entirely absent from the JEDI RFP. The JEDI RFP treats cloud at the tactical edge as an integral part of a cloud service and makes no long-term provisions for building out tactical cloud, two technical and architectural mistakes which are not repeated in the Strategy". DOD's excellent Cloud Strategy is posted at https://media.defense.gov/2019/Feb/04/2002085866/-1/-1/1/DOD-CLOUD-STRATEGY.PDF. "The national security implications of the content of this IT-AAC JEDI Report are fundamental to how the Department of Defense will effectively move toward information sharing in the 21st century. This report succinctly identifies concerns that should be addressed before the JEDI award," states LTG Deptula, USAF Ret. Beyond those items, the report also noted:. Call for Action.
