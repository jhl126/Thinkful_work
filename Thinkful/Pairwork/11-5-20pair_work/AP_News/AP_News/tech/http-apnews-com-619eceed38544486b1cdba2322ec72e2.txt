SALT LAKE CITY (AP) â€” The survey-software provider Qualtrics is planning to expand its Provo-based headquarters, add jobs and build an on-site daycare center that will focus on science, math, engineering and technology. Qualtrics International Inc. said in a news release Thursday the expansion will double the size of the offices when it opens in the spring of 2021. The company plans to add 1,000 new jobs over five years. The daycare facility is scheduled to open in the fall of 2020 across the street. It will offer a STEM-focused curriculum for children up to 5-years-old of employees who pay for the service. A year ago, SAP paid $8 billion to acquire Qualtrics. Qualtrics has announced plans for new office buildings in Seattle, Chicago and Dublin, Ireland.
