A book by Microsoft Research, with open source. https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq/tree/master/examples/m2m_100 — In this work, we create a true Many-to-Many multilingual translation model that can translate directly between any pair of 100 languages. Our focus on non-English-Centric models brings gains of more than 10 BLEU when directly translating between non-English directions while performing competitively with the best single systems of WMT.
