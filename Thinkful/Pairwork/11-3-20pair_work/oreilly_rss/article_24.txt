Natural Language Database Queries — An interesting comment thread on Hacker News. Sample comments: I’ve done some previous digging into natural language SQL queries — there’s a good amount of research around this. But the error rate is always too high for useful production deployment and the systems I’ve looked at never handled ambiguity well. The target user for this is someone who knows nothing about SQL so ambiguity is guaranteed. and I worked for Cleargraph, a startup which built a natural language query layer on top of RDBMSes and which we sold to Tableau. We reached the same conclusions as you: that such a system must properly handle ambiguous queries, and users need to explicitly understand the results they’re viewing.
