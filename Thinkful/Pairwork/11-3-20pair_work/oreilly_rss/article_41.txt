Typing with Pleasure — Measuring the latency in editors: how long it takes until we see the key we just pressed. Spoiler: Gvim awesome, Atom not. EUV Lithography — uses extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light at a wavelength of 13.5 nm to make silicon features down to a few nanometers in size. The older I get, the more I realise that a lot of our software advances depend upon hardware advances. Report of the DOE Quantum Internet Blueprint Workshop — While quantum computing has garnered most of the recent headlines, quantum networking—especially with its promise of secure communication—actually is capturing the interest of a growing community across science, industry, and national security. Today, many people recognize that building and scaling quantum-protected and enhanced communication networks are among the most important technological frontiers of the 21st century. Although a general-purpose quantum computer still is many years away, the research community perceives a quantum Internet may be closer to realization.
