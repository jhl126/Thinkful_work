       "'Des Moines, Iowa (CNN) - Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez capped her debut on the Iowa hustings in support of Bernie Sanders last week with a blunt call to action. \"This is not about something that we allow to happen to us. We don\\'t let this race happen to us,\" she said at a rally for the Vermont senator in Council Bluffs. \"We don\\'t watch the presidential race. This is not a movie, this a movement.\" And yet, there has been a certain cinematic quality to the last six weeks of Sanders\\' second Democratic presidential campaign. Nearly sidelined, or worse, by a heart attack in Las Vegas on the first night of October, Sanders has charted a remarkable revival. It\\'s been powered by a run of invigorating endorsements, new poll results that showed him gaining steam in New Hampshire and Iowa, and the sense, fueled in part by the massive crowds that welcomed him during recent rallies in New York and Minnesota, that his \"political revolution\" was, after a trying summer, back on the march. There are also, as Sanders joked following his Saturday climate summit in Des Moines, the stents to thank. \"I\\'ve got three arteries that are working right now, that\\'s pretty good,\" he deadpanned, while practicing mid-range jumpers on a basketball court at Drake University. \"Better than one blocked artery, so I\\'m feeling really good.\" His supporters and staff are saying much of the same. The backing of Ocasio-Cortez, along with fellow \"squad\" members Rep. Ilhan Omar and Rep. Rashida Tlaib, news of which broke before and during the most recent debate last month in Ohio, bolstered an argument that Sanders has been making for months, that his campaign is steadily attracting a racially diverse, young and working class coalition ready to make an unapologetic case for his democratic socialist vision. Democratic voters, too, have made it clear that Sanders remains front of mind as the primary season approaches. About two weeks after the debate, a CNN poll of Democrats in New Hampshire showed Sanders with a narrow lead over the emerging top tier of candidates, with 21% to Sen. Elizabeth Warren\\'s 18%. Former Vice President Joe Biden came in at 15%, and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, placed fourth with 10%. No one else touched double digits. Recent surveys of Democrats in Iowa show the same group jockeying, mostly within the margin of statistical error, for the top position. A durable candidate. For an elected leader famously disinclined to discuss his own inner life, and whose campaign slogan, \"Not me, us\", is both a comment on his view of politics and a criticism of how its practice is covered by the press, Sanders wry assessment of his arterial functions felt like a revolution in its own right. \"Bernie\\'s back,\" as his campaign puts it, but the person at the center of it all seems just a little bit different. As if he\\'s been freed, finally, to return the embrace of an increasingly influential leftist movement, the largest the country has seen in nearly a century, that has vaulted him to within a relative whisper of the White House. Sanders entered the current Democratic primary in February with the same message he has championed for the better party of four decades. It\\'s one that he pushed in 2016, when he challenged Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination and lost. This time, the world around him had changed, and so too had the expectations surrounding his campaign. No longer an underdog, Sanders began his 2020 bid amid a new round of harrowing questions. What if his supporters in 2016 fled for a fresh face, like former Texas Rep. Beto O\\'Rourke? How would he fair in a more crowded field, with fellow progressive icon Elizabeth Warren now another option for Democrats? Would his appeal wane without Clinton around to play his moderate foil? Could he expand his base beyond the diehards and ideologues, and actually turn out the tuned-out voters, so many young and working class, that so often go underrepresented on Election Day. The answers, to date, are either mixed or inconclusive. There are still nearly three months to go before the Iowa caucuses kick off a primary that is shaping up to be among the messiest in a generation. O\\'Rourke faded and dropped out of the race. But Warren is firmly entrenched among the frontrunners. Clinton\\'s shadow still lingers, for better or worse, and Biden offers a similar contrast, while South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg has emerged a formidable centrist foe. The Bernie base remains firmly in place. Whether he can grow it, and if he can, by how much, is open for debate. In the meantime, Sanders is taking on the most recent source of doubt, his health, with the kind of alternately droll and punchy sense of humor he is traditionally loathe to display in public. \"This is not a beauty contest,\" Sanders said of the primary during his first trip to Iowa after the heart attack, back in October. \"Which obviously I would win, I know that.\" A change of tone. During his brief convalescence at home in Burlington, Vermont, Sanders invited television cameras and reporters inside to answer more detailed questions about his health. But since the most recent primary debate in Ohio, and a rousing rally in New York with Ocasio-Cortez and other young progressive leaders, he\\'s taken a lighter tone. \"Brothers and sisters, I thank you so much for your support, but this is what I want to say. This comes from the bottom of my heart,\" Sanders said at a festive gathering in Detroit, where he was officially endorsed by Tlaib, before pausing for effect. As his smile widened, Sanders delivered the punchline: \"And by the way, my heart is doing just fine.\" Sanders has also injected some of those waggish asides into the sharper stretches of his stump speech. \"Today we tell Donald Trump,\" Sanders said, before stopping himself. \"What can we tell Donald Trump?,\" he asked, in mocking exasperation. \"See, if I use a profane word, I\\'ll get in trouble. All right, all right, he\\'s an idiot. You made me say it. But in this case, I\\'m going to tell the media you made me say it. It\\'s their fault.\" Some things do not change. Sanders\\' leadership team, as it did in 2016, operates in a near-constant state of vigilance when it comes to mainstream press coverage of his campaign. \"As we have said from the beginning, this is a campaign built to win and planning to win,\" campaign manager Faiz Shakir told CNN last month, as Sanders returned to the trail. \"We\\'ve been steadily and consistently executing our strategy, even while the media analysis of our campaign has been in disarray.\" But all is not status quo inside the Sanders campaign. During a recent visit to his campaign office in Washington, DC, Sanders sat and chatted with a group of lower-level staffers. When others began to migrate from across the room for a closer listen, a top aide recalled, Sanders decided to stick around a little longer and give a similar pep talk to those who missed out on the first round. The aide, who has been with the senator since 2016, acknowledged that a candidate. Sanders included, talking to his the staff was not out of the ordinary. But in the aftermath of Sanders\\' heart attack, the tone of those conversations has changed. \"There was a moment of time where his voice, his vision, his fight was taken away. And that was something that jarred people into realizing that there\\'s this amazing opportunity that we have to fight for the progressive future that we all want,\" the aide told CNN. That newfound ability to pull his devoted team closer should not be confused with a softening of the edges. Sanders the progressive pugilist welcomed news of billionaire former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg\\'s prospective run as one might expect: acidly. \"Oh, my goodness. How important, how monumental that he\\'s running for president,\" Sanders said, mimicking a credulous broadcaster, at Drake University. If a candidate with fewer resources entered the race, Sanders added, his voice turned down, \"nobody would give a damn.\" © 2019 Cable News Network. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.

       "['Des Moines, Iowa (CNN) - Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez capped her debut on the Iowa hustings in support of Bernie Sanders last week with a blunt call to action. \"This is not about something that we allow to happen to us. We don\\'t let this race happen to us,\" she said at a rally for the Vermont senator in Council Bluffs. \"We don\\'t watch the presidential race. This is not a movie, this a movement.\" And yet, there has been a certain cinematic quality to the last six weeks of Sanders\\' second Democratic presidential campaign. Nearly sidelined, or worse, by a heart attack in Las Vegas on the first night of October, Sanders has charted a remarkable revival. It\\'s been powered by a run of invigorating endorsements, new poll results that showed him gaining steam in New Hampshire and Iowa, and the sense, fueled in part by the massive crowds that welcomed him during recent rallies in New York and Minnesota, that his \"political revolution\" was, after a trying summer, back on the march. There are also, as Sanders joked following his Saturday climate summit in Des Moines, the stents to thank. \"I\\'ve got three arteries that are working right now, that\\'s pretty good,\" he deadpanned, while practicing mid-range jumpers on a basketball court at Drake University. \"Better than one blocked artery, so I\\'m feeling really good.\" His supporters and staff are saying much of the same. The backing of Ocasio-Cortez, along with fellow \"squad\" members Rep. Ilhan Omar and Rep. Rashida Tlaib, news of which broke before and during the most recent debate last month in Ohio, bolstered an argument that Sanders has been making for months, that his campaign is steadily attracting a racially diverse, young and working class coalition ready to make an unapologetic case for his democratic socialist vision. Democratic voters, too, have made it clear that Sanders remains front of mind as the primary season approaches. About two weeks after the debate, a CNN poll of Democrats in New Hampshire showed Sanders with a narrow lead over the emerging top tier of candidates, with 21% to Sen. Elizabeth Warren\\'s 18%. Former Vice President Joe Biden came in at 15%, and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, placed fourth with 10%. No one else touched double digits. Recent surveys of Democrats in Iowa show the same group jockeying, mostly within the margin of statistical error, for the top position. A durable candidate. For an elected leader famously disinclined to discuss his own inner life, and whose campaign slogan, \"Not me, us\", is both a comment on his view of politics and a criticism of how its practice is covered by the press, Sanders wry assessment of his arterial functions felt like a revolution in its own right. \"Bernie\\'s back,\" as his campaign puts it, but the person at the center of it all seems just a little bit different. As if he\\'s been freed, finally, to return the embrace of an increasingly influential leftist movement, the largest the country has seen in nearly a century, that has vaulted him to within a relative whisper of the White House. Sanders entered the current Democratic primary in February with the same message he has championed for the better party of four decades. It\\'s one that he pushed in 2016, when he challenged Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination and lost. This time, the world around him had changed, and so too had the expectations surrounding his campaign. No longer an underdog, Sanders began his 2020 bid amid a new round of harrowing questions. What if his supporters in 2016 fled for a fresh face, like former Texas Rep. Beto O\\'Rourke? How would he fair in a more crowded field, with fellow progressive icon Elizabeth Warren now another option for Democrats? Would his appeal wane without Clinton around to play his moderate foil? Could he expand his base beyond the diehards and ideologues, and actually turn out the tuned-out voters, so many young and working class, that so often go underrepresented on Election Day. The answers, to date, are either mixed or inconclusive. There are still nearly three months to go before the Iowa caucuses kick off a primary that is shaping up to be among the messiest in a generation. O\\'Rourke faded and dropped out of the race. But Warren is firmly entrenched among the frontrunners. Clinton\\'s shadow still lingers, for better or worse, and Biden offers a similar contrast, while South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg has emerged a formidable centrist foe. The Bernie base remains firmly in place. Whether he can grow it, and if he can, by how much, is open for debate. In the meantime, Sanders is taking on the most recent source of doubt, his health, with the kind of alternately droll and punchy sense of humor he is traditionally loathe to display in public. \"This is not a beauty contest,\" Sanders said of the primary during his first trip to Iowa after the heart attack, back in October. \"Which obviously I would win, I know that.\" A change of tone. During his brief convalescence at home in Burlington, Vermont, Sanders invited television cameras and reporters inside to answer more detailed questions about his health. But since the most recent primary debate in Ohio, and a rousing rally in New York with Ocasio-Cortez and other young progressive leaders, he\\'s taken a lighter tone. \"Brothers and sisters, I thank you so much for your support, but this is what I want to say. This comes from the bottom of my heart,\" Sanders said at a festive gathering in Detroit, where he was officially endorsed by Tlaib, before pausing for effect. As his smile widened, Sanders delivered the punchline: \"And by the way, my heart is doing just fine.\" Sanders has also injected some of those waggish asides into the sharper stretches of his stump speech. \"Today we tell Donald Trump,\" Sanders said, before stopping himself. \"What can we tell Donald Trump?,\" he asked, in mocking exasperation. \"See, if I use a profane word, I\\'ll get in trouble. All right, all right, he\\'s an idiot. You made me say it. But in this case, I\\'m going to tell the media you made me say it. It\\'s their fault.\" Some things do not change. Sanders\\' leadership team, as it did in 2016, operates in a near-constant state of vigilance when it comes to mainstream press coverage of his campaign. \"As we have said from the beginning, this is a campaign built to win and planning to win,\" campaign manager Faiz Shakir told CNN last month, as Sanders returned to the trail. \"We\\'ve been steadily and consistently executing our strategy, even while the media analysis of our campaign has been in disarray.\" But all is not status quo inside the Sanders campaign. During a recent visit to his campaign office in Washington, DC, Sanders sat and chatted with a group of lower-level staffers. When others began to migrate from across the room for a closer listen, a top aide recalled, Sanders decided to stick around a little longer and give a similar pep talk to those who missed out on the first round. The aide, who has been with the senator since 2016, acknowledged that a candidate. Sanders included, talking to his the staff was not out of the ordinary. But in the aftermath of Sanders\\' heart attack, the tone of those conversations has changed. \"There was a moment of time where his voice, his vision, his fight was taken away. And that was something that jarred people into realizing that there\\'s this amazing opportunity that we have to fight for the progressive future that we all want,\" the aide told CNN. That newfound ability to pull his devoted team closer should not be confused with a softening of the edges. Sanders the progressive pugilist welcomed news of billionaire former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg\\'s prospective run as one might expect: acidly. \"Oh, my goodness. How important, how monumental that he\\'s running for president,\" Sanders said, mimicking a credulous broadcaster, at Drake University. If a candidate with fewer resources entered the race, Sanders added, his voice turned down, \"nobody would give a damn.\" © 2019 Cable News Network. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.

       " 'Washington (CNN) - A federal appeals court on Tuesday revived a major threat that President Donald Trump has faced in court since the early days of his presidency, the question of whether he can be sued over his business portfolio, which could give his opponents access to his private business records. The cases related to emoluments have been paused before subpoenas of the Trump Organization were due, and a three-judge panel had dismissed a lawsuit from the District of Columbia and Maryland state attorneys general over unfair competition with the Trump International Hotel. On Tuesday, the full 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals voted to rehear the case, with potentially 15 judges or more, on December 12 in Richmond, Virginia. The District of Columbia and Maryland had previously claimed the Trump International Hotel in Washington harmed hotels and other businesses the states partially own. Trump\\'s win in July killed the lawsuit before the states\\' attorneys general offices could gather financial information from the Trump Organization and Trump himself. Trump had applauded his legal victory on Twitter, writing, \"I won a big part of the Deep State and Democrat induced Witch Hunt.\" He noted the appeals court\\'s 3-0 decision was unanimous. When the case was argued before those three appellate judges, they were notably sympathetic to Trump. But the Circuit\\'s full panel may not be more evenly split politically. They will examine whether the previous courts reasoned correctly. It\\'s uncommon for a rehearing such as this in any appeals courts, though the emoluments issue is a highly unusual case, in that the legal issues involved have almost never been interpreted by the courts. \"A majority of judges in regular active service and not disqualified having voted in a requested poll of the court to grant the petition for rehearing en banc. It is ordered that rehearing en banc is granted,\" the court wrote Tuesday. DC Attorney General Karl Racine and Maryland\\'s Attorney General Brian Frosh called the lawsuit\\'s revival \"significant\" on Tuesday. \"We look forward to arguing our case before the full panel to stop President Trump from violating the Constitution and profiting from the presidency,\" the pair said in a statement. Two other cases testing Trump\\'s compliance with the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution, in New York and in Washington, DC, are still slowly moving through the courts. © 2019 Cable News Network.

       " '(CNN) - Bridge the gap. Cross the divide. Heal the fracture. That\\'s what so many of our readers wish they could do. To help launch our new series, \"Fractured States of America,\" CNN Opinion invited readers to share their own experiences of political division. Some worry that it\\'s already too late, that we\\'ve crossed a threshold of polarization from which there is no return. Others look toward a future where more moderate voices are heeded and heard, and Americans can find better ways to relate to each other. Still others look back to history for a guide, perhaps for what not to do, or at the very least for proof that while it\\'s been bad before, progress is still possible. \"For years we have researched all candidates on both sides and voted for the best candidate even if it went against our party,\" said Teresina Adams of Las Vegas of herself and her husband. \"Now we feel left out of the conversation and we don\\'t recognize either party.\" Kenja Purkey of Amarillo, Texas, took a different perspective; she shared what it\\'s been like to try to build bridges \". between the two divided sides. To that end, I have really tried to work on understanding where we can work together and how to not demonize each other. I still feel like a fish out of water where I live. But I am hopeful that as we try to find common ground that might lessen. I\\'ve also learned that I don\\'t have to compromise what I believe and that it\\'s okay to agree to disagree.\" Hundreds of readers from across the country, espousing views at every point on the spectrum, wrote in to offer their stories. Having read and taken to heart the hundreds and hundreds of responses we received, the underlying message is clear: America has a problem, and it\\'s time for a wake-up call. \"While discussion is healthy, turning it into a sporting match is not,\" said Phil L. of Pennsylvania, echoing many of you who wrote in with stories of how the post-2016 landscape has challenged or painfully altered your long-standing relationships with spouses and friends. You described leaving church communities, being alienated from your children. Eve, a first generation child of immigrants from Rexford, New York, recounted a dinner party where her closest girlfriend \"continued to talk about \\'bad immigrants\\' although my husband begged her to change the subject. Another girlfriend of ours was there; she\\'s a Chinese immigrant.\" Eve\\'s husband ended the conversation and cut off all interaction with her friend. Eve says, \"I am still always pleasant and social with my friend, but I don\\'t feel good about it.\" For a lot of people, this wake-up call needs to take the form of a return to common humanity, a more pragmatic approach to media consumption and greater savvy about social media interaction. For a number, it\\'s even simpler: Start listening to the voices of the moderate majority and de-emphasize (and perhaps de-platform) those shouting from the extreme left and right.\" Some of you took issue with the premise that a surge in division implied some previous time of unity. \"When was America meaningfully united?\" asked Jason R. from Ohio. \"I keep hearing people talk about how this country is so divided nowadays, yet I am in my 30s and cannot remember America being united in a meaningful way during my lifetime.\" Clinton W. of Portland, Oregon, agreed: \"There is no point in time that this country has been great for everyone, only great for a few.\" Rich G. from Tampa, Florida, offered a different approach: in his bitterly divided workplace, he has established (with signage to match) a \"no politics zone.\" With the 2020 presidential election in full swing, impeachment hearings in full swing and the holiday season on the horizon, it\\'s hardly feasible for most Americans to take Rich\\'s approach, much as we might like to. And since these days, most of our lives can\\'t be designated a \"no politics zone,\" it seems exactly right to start where all of us do: our own common sense and the lived realities of our everyday lives. A further sampling of your stories follows below. Some have been lightly edited for clarity and flow, and the views belong to the authors. \\'I was starting to hate people that I have loved for years\\'. I am a black woman in my 40s and also a Christian. I go to a church that is diverse and is comprised of Democrats and Republicans. Since the election of Trump, it seems that everyone on both sides has lost their minds. I have purposely stayed off of social media because I was starting to hate people that I have loved for years. I felt that those who support Trump don\\'t support my rights or views as a minority woman. I am truly heartbroken over some of the hateful things that they say. I am especially disappointed in my Christian friends who blindly follow Trump saying that he a man of God. Even though everything he says goes against the beliefs of the Bible. Particularly love thy neighbor as thyself. On the other side I have friends on the left who have an all-liberal-or-nothing policy that I have to agree with and accept everything they stand for no matter what they do or say just as long as it\\'s liberal. To be honest I am more of a moderate Democrat and my husband is nonpartisan. For years we have researched all candidates on both sides and voted for the best candidate even if it went against our party. Now we feel left out of the conversation and we don\\'t recognize either party. It\\'s sad how how far each side has gone to the left and right. I truly believe that we need to stop and listen to each other. Everyone is so busy trying to get it right all of the time that we are getting it wrong most of the time. The left is too quick to call someone racist, sexist or homophobic and lose their livelihood because of one statement. Those on the right need to be educated and not dismissed completely. Those who are quick to call someone else\\'s flaws out forget that they are also human and have made mistakes or have said something stupid. The difference is that it\\'s not online or on TV for the world to see. Most of us would be horrified if our biggest mistakes were on display. I think that we all need to stop and take a breath and remember that we are that song (we\\'re only human born to make mistakes). We need to treat others the way we want to be treated. Anger gets no one anywhere. We need to fix this national dysfunction quick or we as Americans are doomed to fail. — Teresina Adams, Las Vegas, Nevada. Voting for Trump cost me my friends. I have lost all my friends because I voted for Trump. I\\'ve always voted Democrat. I thought Hillary was corrupt and that Trump was obnoxious. But as I read about his policies I began to see that I agreed with most of them and was willing to overlook his personality flaws. I think if more people were exposed to what he has done that is good, that would change their minds. In any case, I do think that the decision should be made at the polling booth and not though the agony of impeachment. The left is full of hatred. and envy and is unbelievably intolerant of opposing views. What has happened to the loyal opposition? What has happened to America. — Ronda, Delaware County, New York. I feel like I\\'m living in hostile territory. Six months ago, my wife and I moved from cosmopolitan New Orleans to conservative Pensacola, Florida, to be near family and because we could afford a much better house here. One of the first things we did was to invite the neighbors for drinks. And within half an hour of arriving, one of those neighbors loudly proclaimed: \"I hate liberals.\" I was too taken aback to tell him that we were liberals. He\\'s a perfectly decent guy, but those three thoughtless words have totally colored my view of my new home. I can\\'t get them out of my mind, and despite all the evidence to the contrary, I feel I\\'m living in hostile territory. — Phil Goddard, Pensacola, Florida. Our children are watching this bloodsport. Watching the news is America\\'s new bloodsport. My husband is a staunch Trump supporter. I left the party before Trump was even nominated. We\\'ve had some bitter fights over politics since the election, but our marriage and our children are the best parts of our lives. We\\'ve ceased attempts to convince each other and resolved to stop trying. I\\'m a high school teacher. He\\'s a pilot. We\\'re both veterans. We\\'ve both lived outside this country and traveled the world enough to have a deep understanding of how truly fortunate we are to call this place home. All Americans need to consider the long-term consequences of this political poison. Our children are watching. They\\'ll inherit the America we\\'re debating today. I hope it\\'s not a divided nation on the brink of civil war. — Susie D., Virginia Beach, Virginia. A student\\'s Nazi-style salute reflects the hate. While substitute teaching, I was monitoring students working on an essay for Veterans\\' Day, entitled, \"What Makes America Great.\" (The essays were intended for a competition sponsored by a veterans\\' organization.) One student in particular was struggling to get beyond their initial statement that America\\'s greatness was based upon, \"veterans, not-illegal immigrants. \" When I questioned the student about what was meant by \"not-illegal immigrants?\" The student replied, \"the ones that come here with the right paperwork and stuff. They don\\'t come here and take our taxes and get on welfare, so we have to support them. The legal ones come through that place in New York.\" A classmate prompted the student with the suggestion of Ellis Island. The student went on to state that the veterans were what made America great. \"They fought and died for us.\" This student went on to express their disdain for the immigrants who were entering the country illegally, regardless of the circumstances behind those decisions. Following a brief break in classes, the student returned to the classroom with their hand held high in a Nazi-style salute. I asked that they put their hand down and the student replied that they were just waving hello. The student walked back out into the hall, briefly, and returned once again with the salute. I approached the student and directly stated, \"You claim to believe that our veterans are what make America great, because they risked their lives for us. My father, the son of immigrants, was a US veteran who risked his life to stop the flow of Nazism in the world. That salute is in support of what my father served to stop. I will not tolerate that symbol in my presence.\" Following that exchange the student finally stopped offering hate-filled challenges. It hurts my heart to see so many young people that are filled with hate for others, simply because they have no understanding beyond the hate-filled rhetoric they are hearing at home and in the media to which they are exposed. — Carol, South Dakota. Our leaders reflect the worst of us. I feel isolated from my upbringing and my personal history. The state of my childhood has gone solid red and classmates\\' social media reflect views that in no way reflect mine. I\\'ve been peripatetic over the last 30 years and feel like I have more understanding, more empathy and more tolerance. There is no middle ground, except that of good manners and self-censorship. Partisanship infantilizes voters and is a destructive force in America. Our leaders reflect the worst of our natures right now. — Beth A., North Carolina. The lesson of Trump\\'s election. I\\'m a veteran of the Navy. President Trump is unlike any other president in recent years. He\\'s not a typical status quo politician. He is a shrewd learned businessman. Yes he can be an ass at times but as a whole he has done good for our country. He\\'s delivered or put in play most of what he campaigned on. All the Democrats have done since he was elected is b**** and try to overthrow a duly elected president instead of working to better our country with him. The idiocy of the Democrats is so prevalent they don\\'t realize if they want to win elections they need to connect with Trump\\'s supporters not alienate them also not have 20-plus people running for president. — Brian Barrios, Warren, Ohio. I truly believe I will be assaulted over a bumper sticker. I am a lifelong Democrat, my husband is a lifelong Republican, we have always been able to openly discuss our opinions and respect our differences inside our home or with friends in all political parties. Today we don\\'t even breathe which party we belong to outside our home because it invariably leads to shouting and name calling, with us being on the receiving end. The civil discourse in this country is as heartbreaking as it is scary. I fear putting a bumper sticking on my car because I live in a Republican stronghold and I fear retaliation. I truly believe I will be assaulted or perhaps even shot because of a bumper sticker on my car. That is where we are today in America, it\\'s a shame. It starts at the top, if everyone would tone down the hate, we all would be better off. We all have good ideas but we are spending too much time on name calling and not enough time listening to each other. — Joanne C., Arizona. It already feels like a cold war. I live in Adam Schiff\\'s L.A. congressional district but hail from conservative rural Michigan where I travel back frequently to be with family. It\\'s disturbing and scary to see the polarization worsen over the past few years. People live in two different realities. One side\\'s heroes are the other side\\'s enemies. I can feel the anger growing on both sides. Will California and Texas go to war someday? It already feels like a cold war. — Michael Peterson, Los Angeles, California. My identical twin sister and I can\\'t agree on anything about politics. I have an identical twin. We both had our DNA tested on 23andMe. It came out we are identical down to every item. My daughter now has 2 mothers listed on her profile on 23andMe. That is how close we are physically. Politically we are totally opposite. She went from being a Democrat supporting Hillary Clinton to one of the \"base\" for Donald Trump. I am and always have been an extreme lefty. Total Bernie supporter. I am at a loss as to how this happened to her. What is it that changed for her? She blames Obama for all her problems. If it wasn\\'t for Obamacare she wouldn\\'t have insurance. Of course she doesn\\'t see it that way. I try to ask her how she can think like a Trumper. All I get are digs and putdowns about my \"socialist\" beliefs. We can argue about this for hours. My mother just hates it when we argue about Trump. We had to agree not to talk politics around her. I have also decided not talk to her about it. It is like talking to a brick wall. She believes what she believes and I believe what I believe. How to fix this? I have no idea. What works for us is to ignore the problem. We get along fine as long as there is no talk about politics. Get rid of Trump and maybe it would help. We need to start building up our country and get the corruption out of our government. Maybe we need to hit rock bottom and then we can start to rebuild. We are there. — Lynn Root, Covington, Washington. When was America really united. When was America meaningfully united? I keep hearing people talk about how this country is so divided nowadays, yet I am in my 30s and cannot remember America being united in a meaningful way during my lifetime. When I was 10 years old in 1998, America was divided over race, gender and sexuality, class, and the President Clinton impeachment probe. Similarly, when I was 20 in 2008, America was divided in its reaction to Barack Obama\\'s election victory, with some seeing him as a savior while others flew upside down flags. People may point to the period immediately following 9/11 as one of unity, but that mourning very quickly gave way to neoconservative bloodlust and vengeance, which resulted in the Patriot Act and 18 years of futile brushfire war which further divided this nation. Sometimes, I suspect that what people, be they liberal or conservative, really mean by \"unity\" amounts to knuckling under. They don\\'t want to hear anyone complain about drone strikes, the police state, migrant internment facilities and deportations or climate change. This \"unity\" is one of blissful, selfish apathy. I\\'m reminded of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr\\'s comments about white moderates posing a greater threat to racial equality than white supremacists. If America truly intends to mend its myriad social maladies, it will undoubtedly require some radical, and yes, divisive measures to do so. One can\\'t make an omelet without breaking eggs. — Jason R., Ohio. This is when I learned all Trump supporters weren\\'t awful people. I live in a very conservative area of Texas and spent four years working in a Republican congressman\\'s district office in the 1990s. I started to see the rancor and divide in the calls we got, constituents who actually believed conspiracies about the Clintons killing people. Then the Tea Party happened, and I no longer recognized the Republican Party with which I had aligned myself. Of course, that worsened during the election with the awful rhetoric. People in my area seemed to eat it up and that always scared me. We\\'ve had groups that paid to have a highway billboard that said if you were liberal to keep driving. I\\'ve been threatened for my support of having a Confederate statue removed from a local park. But I learned my lesson early. There was a house in my neighborhood that had Trump signs all over it leading to the election. I often wondered what awful people lived there. One day, while walking through the park with a friend, a lovely couple began walking with us and to my shock, I learned THEY lived in the house with the Trump signs. So that\\'s when I learned all Trump supporters weren\\'t awful people. I watched the night of the election with growing concern and as he was declared the winner, I decided I was going to work toward being a bridge between the two divided sides. To that end, I have really tried to work on understanding where we can work together and how to not demonize each other. I was instrumental in helping bring a group called Better Angels to Amarillo for training with people from both sides of the political spectrum on how to find common ground and we hope to use what we\\'ve learned in our community and to talk with our representatives. I still feel like a fish out of water where I live. But I am hopeful that as we try to find common ground that might lessen. I\\'ve also learned that I don\\'t have to compromise what I believe and that it\\'s okay to agree to disagree. — Kenja Purkey, Amarillo, Texas. Focus on communal success. The economic, political, cultural, religious, and intellectual polarization of our country has threatened to tear apart who we are as a people. It\\'s casualties have included friends and families alike. In my own microcosm, the lifetime friendships that have been built between myself, my best friend, and our other six besties, who we\\'ve been tightly bonded with since we became friends in middle school, have been strained, nearly shattered. We\\'ve all seen each other through marriages, divorces, births, miscarriages, deaths, affairs, bankruptcy, employment challenges, you name it. Nothing has ever pulled at, let alone nearly eviscerated, the ties that have bound us together for more than 40 years. We\\'re all 53 years old now and have seen increasingly vast gaps develop between us over the past 3 years. As our political views have changed, we\\'ve experienced dynamics we\\'ve never witnessed before in our group. We\\'ve had fights break out during our traditional get-togethers throughout the year. Not fist-a-cuffs, but yelling, crying and loudly storming out of restaurants, outbursts on social media, etc. We will not be beaten by this. I think nothing short of a new-aged \"Contract with America\" between the three co-equal branches to government and the citizenry that rejuvenates and refuses the principles, policies, and personal commitment to restoring and retaining a great nation of co-equals, will reintroduce balance. We need to reinvest in the concept that a successful future for America depends on everyone, no matter what demographics define them, and live the concept of the \"whole being greater than the sum of its parts.\" Focusing on communal success will bring us back from the extremes and back to a more bell shaped curve of socioeconomic model. — Kathi Ghannam, Virginia. I left the evangelical church. I left the evangelical church after nearly 50 years in it because I could not side with those who see Trump as their savior. For the first time, I saw friends I knew for decades believe that Trump is somehow a good person. They didn\\'t care about his misogyny, his racism, his bankruptcies, adultery, or his demonization of immigrants, Muslims, and people of color. They became people I never wanted to know, so I lost many friendships and my church. I won\\'t be reconciling with them because now that I have seen their true colors, there is no way back. This experience has introduced me, however, to many, many new friends who believe in equality, justice, compassion, and kindness, and so I have forged a new path forward, one that does not include those in my past who are unable to see that Trump is dangerous for democracy. — Akiko Bergeron, Clearwater, Florida. Give the people you love precedence over politics. My stepdaughter and I have had some knock-down-drag-out battles about the role of government. She is a progressive with a genuine desire to make the world a better place. I, on the other hand, am a small government libertarian. I believe that government is the cause, and not the solution to much of the world\\'s problems. After one terrible fight, we didn\\'t speak for months. When we finally started talking again, she led off with a political statement. I told her \"I won\\'t be discussing politics with you anymore, because you are more important to me than any argument.\" She\\'s driven to make the world fair, and has been since I met her 18 years ago. I may not agree with her in terms of policy, but she is a smart, funny, capable woman, and I am very, very proud of her. If you want to heal the divide, give the people you love precedence over politics. Love and respect will go a long way to heading off the rancor and personal attacks endemic in today\\'s political environment. — Michael L., Maine. © 2019 Cable News Network.

       " 'Washington (CNN) - During a meeting in the Oval Office Wednesday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan pulled out an iPad to show a small group of Republican senators and President Donald Trump a propaganda video casting the Kurds in a negative light, according to a GOP source familiar with the situation. The source called the video, which was first reported by Axios, \"surreal\" and \"straight propaganda.\" Lindsey Graham, Jim Risch, Ted Cruz, Joni Ernst and Rick Scott all attended the candid and at times tense meeting, which lasted about 90 minutes. Reporters were briefly invited in to see the lawmakers raise their foreign policy concerns with Erdogan, specifically addressing the sale of Russian weapons to Turkey and Turkey\\'s conflicts with the Kurds. The senators \"did most of the talking\" with Trump \"playing traffic cop,\" the GOP source said. The senators warned that Turkey will face US sanctions unless it reverses course on the purchase of a Russian missile defense system, a senior administration official and two sources familiar with the matter said. Trump invited the five senators, all of whom have been vocal critics\\' of Turkey\\'s acquisition of the S-400 system, in order to show Erdoğan the strong opposition he faces, a senior administration official said. It was also in part an effort by to show Erdoğan that his hands are tied on the sanctions issue. \"We saw it as more good cop, bad cop,\" one source said of the meeting, noting the group showed Erdoğan that Trump\\'s \"hands were tied\" because the Senate isn\\'t going to give Turkey F-35s if they don\\'t get rid of the S-400. \"To the extent that Erdoğan understands now the leverage and strength that the Senate has on this. that was helpful,\" the administration official said. In order to demonstrate that unified front, national security adviser Robert O\\'Brien held a call with the five Republican senators before the meeting in order to get them on the same page about focusing on the S-400 issue, two administration officials and a Senate Republican source said. Trump also warned Erdoğan in his letter that week that sanctions were coming if Turkey deploys the S-400 system, but a source familiar with the meeting said the senators were more forthright on Wednesday. The threat of sanctions was the focus of the Oval Office meeting, but the Republican senators also delivered candid and sometimes heated criticisms to Erdoğan about other issues. Graham, who has been a vocal critic of Turkey\\'s invasion of Syria, at one point engaged in a heated back-and-forth with Erdoğan over the subject and the fate of the US\\'s Kurdish allies, the senior administration official and two sources familiar said. Graham \"was pretty aggressive on Syria,\" one source said. Scott also raised serious questions about Turkey\\'s ongoing membership in NATO as it grows increasingly cozier with Russia. Cruz said in a statement that he pushed Erdoğan on the S-400 system and the attack on the Kurds. \"I have always described Turkey as an ally, a deeply problematic ally, but an ally nonetheless, in a very troubled region of the world. I went to the White House today to tell President Erdoğan exactly that,\" he said, calling Turkish attacks on Kurds \"absolutely unacceptable\" and saying he \"made clear\" to the Turkish leader that the US will not sell F-35 jets to Turkey \"so long as as Turkey continues to procure or deploy the S-400 air defense system from Russia.\" Trump invited these senators knowing they would be candid in their views. He wanted a frank discussion and wanted the lawmakers to air their concerns, one source familiar with the conversations said, adding that Trump believes it\\'s important to maintain a positive relationship with Erdoğan and isn\\'t concerned that other US officials, like these lawmakers, feel differently. A senior administration official said Trump first raised the possibility of inviting the senators to meet Erdoğan last week. A source familiar with the matter said it gave Trump an opportunity to avoid directly confronting Erdoğan on the S-400 issue while still raising the concerns in an official capacity. © 2019 Cable News Network.

       " '(CNN) - A child prodigy from Belgium is on course to gain a bachelor\\'s degree at the tender age of nine. Laurent Simons is studying electrical engineering at the Eindhoven University of Technology (TUE), a tough course even for students of an average graduate age. Described by staff as \"simply extraordinary,\" Laurent is on course to finish his degree in December. He then plans to embark on a PhD program in electrical engineering while also studying for a medicine degree, his father told CNN. His parents, Lydia and Alexander Simons, said they thought Laurent\\'s grandparents were exaggerating when they said he had a gift, but his teachers soon concurred. \"They noticed something very special about Laurent,\" said Lydia. Laurent was given test after test as teachers tried to work out the extent of his talents. \"They told us he is like a sponge,\" said Alexander. While Laurent comes from a family of doctors, his parents have so far not received any explanation as to why their child prodigy is capable of learning so quickly. But Lydia has her own theory. \"I ate a lot of fish during the pregnancy,\" she joked. The TUE has allowed Laurent to complete his course faster than other students. \"That is not unusual,\" said Sjoerd Hulshof, education director of the TUE bachelor\\'s degree in Electrical Engineering, in a statement. \"Special students that have good reasons for doing so can arrange an adjusted schedule. In much the same way we help students who participate in top sport.\" Hulshof said Laurent is \"simply extraordinary\" and praised the youngster. \"Laurent is the fastest student we have ever had here,\" he said. \"Not only is he hyper intelligent but also a very sympathetic boy.\" Laurent told CNN his favorite subject is electrical engineering and he\\'s also \"going to study a bit of medicine.\" His progress has not gone unnoticed and he is already being sought out by prestigious universities around the world, although Laurent\\'s family wouldn\\'t be drawn on naming which of them he is considering for his PhD. \"The absorption of information is no problem for Laurent,\" said his father. \"I think the focus will be on research and applying the knowledge to discover new things.\" While Laurent is evidently able to learn faster than most, his parents are being careful to let him enjoy himself too. \"We don\\'t want him to get too serious. He does whatever he likes,\" said Alexander. \"We need to find a balance between being a child and his talents.\" Laurent said he enjoys playing with his dog Sammy and playing on his phone, like many young people. However, unlike most nine-year-olds, he has already worked out what he wants to do with his life: develop artificial organs. In the meantime, Laurent has to finish his bachelor\\'s degree and choose which academic institution will play host to the next stage in his remarkable journey. Before that, he plans on taking a vacation to Japan for an undoubtedly well-deserved break. © 2019 Cable News Network. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

       " '(CNN) - A gunman opened fire at Saugus High School in Santa Clarita Thursday morning. It\\'s a reality many students there had been fighting to end. They joined the March For Our Lives movement. They held town halls with local leaders. Their school developed an in-depth safety plan in case a day like today ever came. After the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida, Saugus High students joined thousands in nationwide walkouts in March 2018, leaving their classrooms for 15 minutes to protest gun violence, the Santa Clarita Valley Signal reported at the time. The next month, a few of them hosted a gun control town hall with local leaders advocating for safer schools. \"It\\'s very easy to look at today\\'s politics and make quick judgments,\" Saugus High student Lèan Aguilar said in April 2018. \"What isn\\'t easy is having a one-on-one conversation with one another, and engaging in this town hall.\" Former California Rep. Katie Hill, a Saugus High School alumnus, told CNN that students at the school interned for her campaign. Many of them feared the day a school shooting would strike their campus. \"It\\'s almost like the students I have worked with over the course of the campaign knew it was going to be coming,\" she said. \"It was only a matter of time.\" This is a developing story.

       " 'Editor\\'s Note: Daniel Yudkin is associate director of research at the nonpartisan organization More in Common and a postdoctoral fellow at the Behavioral Science Initiative at the University of Pennsylvania. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. (CNN) - We live at a time when many Americans will happily proclaim, pronounce and prognosticate endlessly about politics. But despite the confidence of pundits, politicians and social media personalities, there\\'s a startling blind spot in their understanding: what the other side actually believes. This finding emerges from new research, based on a survey involving a representative sample of 2,100 American adults, which was conducted by the nonpartisan organization More in Common, where I am the associate director of research. Participants in the survey first stated whether they agreed or disagreed with a number of statements concerning issues affecting Americans, from climate change (i.e., \"People are right to be worried about how climate change might affect us\") to gun control (i.e. \"The government should do more to stop guns getting in the hands of bad people\"). Then we asked participants to guess what percentage of their political opponents agreed or disagreed with similar statements. This allowed us to compare belief to reality when it comes to Americans\\' understanding of each other. The results were surprising. Overall, Americans dramatically overestimate the extremity of their opponents\\' views. Both Democrats and Republicans overestimate the proportion of their political opponents holding immoderate views by about 20 percentage points or more. Independents, on average, misjudge Democrats\\' and Republicans\\' views by about 16 percentage points. For example, the proportion of Democrats who agree that \"most police are bad people\" (15%) is less than a third of what Republicans suspect (52%). Similarly, the proportion of Republicans who deny that \"racism exists\" (21%) is less than half what Democrats estimate (49%). We call this the \"perception gap\" in American politics, the yawning chasm between Americans\\' suspicions and reality. I myself encountered a vivid illustration of the perception gap when, having grown up in liberal New England, I visited my extended family in Kansas for the first time in my mid-20s. The kind and thoughtful people I met were a far cry from the backward farmers they had so often been painted as by friends and media. But our research revealed still more interesting facts about the perception gap in American politics. Consider the following question: What is the term length of a US senator. We found that, ironically, the perception gap of people who answered this question correctly (six years) is 20% higher than those who don\\'t. In other words, the more people know about the political system, the worse they may be at guessing what their opponents actually believe. Similarly, people who regularly post political content on social media counterintuitively have a 50% wider perception gap than those who don\\'t. The perception gap is also wider among people who consume various types of media. For example, people who follow the news \"most of the time\" are almost three times less accurate than those who do so \"only now and then.\" Why do the most politically knowledgeable people have the widest perception gap? One possible reason is the spurious effects of social media. Because the internet amplifies the most extreme voices, it is easy to assume those voices stand for the majority. But, in fact, according to our research, they represent only a tiny fraction of the American electorate. Another reason for this gap may be that, increasingly, people are sorting themselves into demographically isolated pockets where they rarely if ever are forced to confront those with whom they disagree. This leads people to stereotype their opponents as evil or ignorant without having to consider the unique set of values that led them to their beliefs. Indeed, our data show, for example, that people with the most politically homogenous friend groups are those on the political extremes. Far from conforming to the caricatures their counterparts subject them to, the vast majority of Americans are flexible in their views, open to compromise and eager to see politicians make progress on important shared issues, such as addressing economic inequality and enacting commonsense gun reform. We call this group the \"exhausted majority.\" Members of the group are not as often heard from in the political conversation because they don\\'t succumb to the black-and-white thinking that drives their more extreme counterparts. But in some ways, they appear to have a better understanding of the political landscape and will likely form a critical part of the coalition of any winning political movement in the years to come. © 2019 Cable News Network.

       " 'Washington (CNN) - President Donald Trump made 67 false claims last week, 27 of them related to Democrats\\' impeachment inquiry. This was the sixth consecutive week in which Trump made more false claims about impeachment or Ukraine than about any other subject. Trump\\'s three most frequent false claims of the week were all impeachment-related. He said seven times that the whistleblower has disappeared (there is no evidence of this), four times that the whistleblower\\'s complaint was inaccurate (it has proven highly accurate), and four times that the Washington Post fabricated its sources for an article about how Trump had reportedly tried to get Attorney General William Barr to hold a news conference declaring he had committed no crimes in his July call with Ukraine\\'s president (there is no evidence the Post invented any sources; other news outlets, including CNN, quickly followed the Post scoop with similar reports). Trump has made 1,202 false claims in the 18 weeks we have been fact checking him at CNN, about 10 false claims per day. Last week\\'s total of 67 false claims was his eighth-highest weekly total. The most egregious false claim: Unearned credit in Louisiana. The Cameron LNG (liquefied natural gas) export facility in Hackberry, Louisiana, has its own website, which explains that the federal government approved the facility in 2014, then approved an expansion in 2016. Trump visited the facility in May, and quickly began claiming he was personally responsible for securing the approvals that were granted while Obama was president. Trump did it again during his rally in Louisiana last Wednesday. This time, he made the tale even more egregious by sprinkling some supposed quotes from himself into the fictional timeline. \"They couldn\\'t get their permits for years. I got them real fast,\" he said. \"I said, \\'How long?\\' I said, \\'Let\\'s go get them that permit. The most pointless exaggeration: Filling the judiciary. Trump gave a speech last Wednesday about milestones he had reached in his quest to shape the federal judiciary. He had impressive numbers at his disposal. As of that day, 25% of circuit judges were people he had put on the bench. Trump recited this \"one out of every four\" statistic from his text. Then, because he is an incorrigible exaggerator, he added that the real number has \"exceeded that by quite a bit,\" though that was not true. The most absurd false claim: Thank you for the imaginary approval rating. Trump went out of his way to express gratitude last week. Three separate times, he tweeted about his \"95% Approval Rating in the Republican Party\", then added, each time, \"Thank you! We check the polls each time he tweets the \"95%\" claim; it has never been true. Trump\\'s Republican approval last week was at 89% in Gallup polling for October and lower in the 80s in major November polls by other prominent pollsters, definitely impressive, just not as high as he keeps saying. At this point, Trump making up numbers is to be expected. What\\'s more interesting is how he sometimes takes an extra step, by, say, professing thanks for a level of support he does not have, to disguise his dishonesty as authenticity. Below is this week\\'s full list of 67 false claims, starting with the ones we haven\\'t included in a weekly update before:. Ukraine and impeachment. \"I\\'m not concerned about anything. The testimony has all been fine. I mean, for the most part, I\\'ve never even heard of these people. I have no idea who they are. It seems that nobody has any firsthand knowledge. There is no firsthand knowledge\". November 8 exchange with reporters before Marine One departure. \"They\\'re having people. I never even heard of some of these people; I don\\'t know who they are. And, by the way, it\\'s all third-hand knowledge. But regardless of what anyone says, read the transcript\". November 9 exchange with reporters before Air Force One departure. Facts First: It is not true that none of the people who testified in the impeachment inquiry had firsthand knowledge or that they all had \"third-hand\" knowledge. Trump didn\\'t say what precisely he was referring to; the witnesses have had firsthand knowledge of various components of the story. But Trump was incorrect even if he was talking specifically about knowledge of his phone call with Zelensky. Witnesses Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman and Tim Morrison of the White House\\'s National Security Council both listened to the call; so did witness Jennifer Williams, an aide to Vice President Mike Pence. The media and Trump\\'s comments. Question: \"You said the impeachment hearings should not be held behind closed doors, but now you say you don\\'t want them to be public. So --\" Trump: \"No, no. I don\\'t care if they\\'re public; they should be public. What I said, it was misreported, as usual. What I said is very simple: There shouldn\\'t be anything. There shouldn\\'t be impeachment hearings, is what I said. So maybe they misconstrued it\". November 9 exchange with reporters before Air Force One departure. Facts First: The media did not misreport Trump\\'s comments the day prior. He had said \"they shouldn\\'t be having public hearings,\" not that \"there shouldn\\'t be anything\" or \"there shouldn\\'t be impeachment hearings.\" The day before, Trump was asked, \"And what do you expect for the public hearings next week?\" Trump responded, \"Well, they shouldn\\'t be having public hearings. This is a hoax. This is just like the Russian witch hunt. This is just a continuation.\" It makes sense that Trump had actually meant that he doesn\\'t think there should be any kind of hearings at all. But that\\'s not what he said, so the issue was with the clarity of his original comments, not with the reporting of them. Gordon Sondland\\'s comments. \"Let me just tell you, I hardly know the gentleman Gordon Sondland. But this is the man who said there was no quid pro quo, and he still says that. and he says that I said that. And he hasn\\'t changed that testimony. So this is a man that said, as far as the President is concerned, there was no quid pro quo\". November 8 exchange with reporters before Marine One departure. Facts First: Trump was accurate on one part of this claim, inaccurate on another. Trump was correct that Sondland, his ambassador to the European Union, had not changed his testimony that Trump said there was no quid pro quo with Ukraine. But the additional testimony Sondland submitted last Monday effectively conceded that there was indeed a quid pro quo. You can read a full fact check on Trump\\'s comments about Sondland here. Rep. Adam Schiff\\'s comments. \"But here\\'s a guy Schiff that made up a conversation, totally, I mean, not even like, he didn\\'t use one word that I said. He just totally made it up, and it sounded terrible\". November 4 interview with WKYT of Lexington, Kentucky. Facts First: Trump can reasonably criticize Schiff for Schiff\\'s comments at a House Intelligence Committee hearing in September; as we\\'ve written before, Schiff\\'s mix of near-quotes from Trump, his own analysis, and supposed \"parody\" was at the very least confusing. But Trump exaggerated when he said Schiff \"didn\\'t use one word that I said.\" You can read our full breakdown of Schiff\\'s comments here. The Washington Post\\'s article on Barr. \"The story in the Amazon Washington Post, of course picked up by Fake News CNN, saying \\'President Trump asked for AG Barr to host a news conference clearing him on Ukraine,\\' is totally untrue and just another FAKE NEWS story with anonymous sources that don\\'t exist\". November 7 tweet. \"Bill Barr did not decline my request to talk about Ukraine. The story was a Fake Washington Post con job with an \\'anonymous\\' source that doesn\\'t exist\". November 7 tweet. \"The degenerate Washington Post MADE UP the story about me asking Bill Barr to hold a news conference. Never happened, and there were no sources!\". November 7 tweet. \"With that being said, it\\'s fake news. They wrote a fake story. We\\'ve told them that before they wrote the story. But today, when you tell the press something, it\\'s meaningless because they write whatever, it\\'s all fiction. And I\\'ll tell you, they don\\'t have sources. You know what they do? They make it up. Not everybody, not John, not everybody. But they make it up\". November 8 exchange with reporters before Marine One departure. Facts First: We won\\'t call Trump inaccurate for denying this Washington Post report, though CNN, the New York Times and other news outlets soon reported the same thing, but there is simply no evidence that the Post fabricated the existence of its sources for the article. Post executive editor Marty Baron said in a statement: \"The Post fully stands behind its story and its reporters, who are among the finest journalists anywhere. The president continues to make false accusations against news organizations and individual journalists. Despite his repugnant attempt to intimidate and harass The Post and its staff, we will continue to do the work that democracy demands of a free and independent press.\" The economy under Trump. \"We\\'ve never had an economy like this before in our history, and it does make things easier. But if our opponent had gotten in, this economy, instead of being up 60, 70%, would have been down 60 or 70%, and that\\'s guaranteed\". November 8 speech to Black Voices for Trump. Facts First: We can\\'t fact check the hypothetical about what would have happened if Hillary Clinton had been elected, but \"the economy\" is not up 60% or 70% under Trump. The economy grew by less than 3% in 2017 and 2018. Trump may have been conflating the economy as a whole with the stock market, which is, of course, not the same. (The NASDAQ was up more than 60% from the date of his election to the date he spoke here.) Job creation in Kentucky. \"Under his Gov. Matt Bevin\\'s leadership, Kentucky has created over 57,000 new jobs, but I helped also, we worked together\". November 4 campaign rally in Lexington, Kentucky. Facts First: Between the month Bevin was sworn in, December 2015, and September 2019, the last month for which data was available at the time, 39,300 net non-farm jobs were added in Kentucky. The \"over 57,000\" figure is for a separate measure the Kentucky state government uses: \"announced jobs\", jobs that \"private-sector manufacturing, service and tech companies plan to create in the future,\" Jack Mazurak, spokesman for the Kentucky Cabinet for Economic Development, said in an email. There is nothing wrong with the state counting such announcements, but this is not a count of jobs actually created. Mazurak acknowledged that announced jobs sometimes do not come to fruition. \"We remove announced projects from the rolling total when a company tells us the project is canceled. And we adjust the numbers when a company tells us the project has changed substantially,\" he said. (He also noted that the announced jobs count does not include \"non-profit, hospital, education, retail, restaurant, financial services or government sectors. \"Now, one out of every four circuit judges currently on the bench was appointed by this administration. And that number has now exceeded that by quite a bit\". November 6 speech on judicial confirmation milestones. Facts First: Trump\\'s first sentence was correct. His second was not. As of the day Trump spoke here, 44 of his nominees for circuit judge had been confirmed, precisely 25% of the 176 active-status circuit judges and just about 25% (24.6%) of the 179 circuit judgeships authorized by law, according to Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution who tracks judicial appointments. So Trump was bang on, but he then did his trademark exaggerating. (Trump was obviously vague when he said \"that number has now exceeded that by quite a bit,\" but he appeared to be saying the actual percentage of Trump appointees, \"that,\" has now exceeded \"that\" figure, 25%, \"by quite a bit. The history of judicial confirmations. \"No president in history has confirmed as many circuit court judges even close, not even close, in such a short period of time\". November 6 speech on judicial confirmation milestones. Facts First: \"The statement is demonstrably false,\" said Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution who tracks judicial appointments. At this point in Jimmy Carter\\'s presidency, Wheeler noted, \"the Senate had confirmed 45 circuit judges,\" one more than had been confirmed under Trump. Wheeler added that Carter and Richard Nixon were both ahead of Trump at the time if you look at the percentage of authorized circuit judgeships they had filled, 31% for each of them to Trump\\'s 25%. And John F. Kennedy was also at 25%, Wheeler said. The Trump Foundation and New York. \"All they found was incredibly effective philanthropy and some small technical violations, such as not keeping board minutes\". November 7 Twitter statement about the Trump Foundation. Facts First: The New York state investigation into the Trump Foundation uncovered issues far more significant than a failure to keep board minutes. In ordering Trump to pay $2 million in damages, a state judge wrote that a review of the record \"establishes that Mr. Trump breached his fiduciary duty to the Foundation and that waste occurred to the Foundation.\" Trump acknowledged in the settlement that the Foundation did not even have board meetings between 1999 and November 2018; that Foundation money was used to resolve a lawsuit involving Trump\\'s private Mar-a-Lago club (he reimbursed the Foundation ten years later, in 2017) and to buy a painting of Trump (the Foundation was eventually reimbursed); and that the Foundation had made a $25,000 donation to support the re-election campaign of Pam Bondi, the former Florida attorney general (Trump reimbursed the Foundation three yeas later). What constitutes a \"small technical violation\" is open for debate, but it\\'s clear that the Foundation\\'s issues went far beyond trivial administrative transgressions. In her damages order, Justice Saliann Scarpulla addressed one issue that had not been resolved in the settlement: the Foundation\\'s activities related to a televised fundraiser Trump held in Des Moines, Iowa, in January 2016, days before the Iowa caucuses. She found that \"Mr. Trump\\'s fiduciary duty breaches included allowing his campaign to orchestrate the Fundraiser, allowing his campaign, instead of the Foundation, to direct distribution of the Funds, and using the Fundraiser and distribution of the Funds to further Mr. Trump\\'s political campaign.\" Scarpulla did note that money raised \"ultimately\" reached veterans charities, and she declined to order punitive damages. Andy Beshear and energy. \"But Beshear wants to shut down your coal, shut down your energy. \". November 4 campaign rally in Lexington, Kentucky. Facts First: There is no evidence that Beshear wants to shut down either Kentucky\\'s coal industry or its energy industry more broadly. Beshear opposed President Barack Obama\\'s Clean Power Plan, which sought to reduce carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants. Beshear\\'s campaign website advocates an \"all-the-above energy policy that includes renewables and clean-coal technology.\" While Beshear has called for Kentucky to \"diversify\" its energy industry and move into \"as many renewables as possible,\" he has never called for a shutdown of coal. Beshear has claimed victory in last week\\'s election. The state\\'s vote count, which has not yet been certified, shows Beshear leading incumbent Republican Matt Bevin by 5,189 votes with 100% of counties reporting. (Bevin has not conceded.) The Wall Street Journal noted in its article on the election results: \"Mr. Beshear carried a number of counties in eastern Kentucky\\'s coal country that are bastions of support for Mr. Trump and some that Mr. Bevin won in 2015.\" Amy McGrath and borders. \"She wants open borders\". November 4 campaign rally in Lexington, Kentucky. Facts First: There is no evidence that Amy McGrath, a Democratic Senate candidate in Kentucky, wants \"open borders.\" McGrath has called Trump\\'s proposed border wall \"stupid,\" saying it is an outdated solution to a modern problem, but she does not support completely unrestricted migration; she has called for the use of \"better technologies,\" like drones, to improve border enforcement, and she has said that \"it\\'s OK to have physical barriers\" in \"certain areas.\" McGrath told Insider Louisville in July that she prefers a comprehensive immigration reform package in which \"we have a path to legal status for Dreamers and those folks that have been around a long time here in the United States, and we also secure our borders and make sure we know who\\'s coming across our borders.\" \". chain migration. You know, that\\'s when you come in and then everybody you ever met in the history of the world comes in with you, your mother, your grandfather, your cousin, your brother, your aunt, your uncle, any person that ever met you: come on into our country\". November 6 campaign rally in Monroe, Louisiana. Facts First: Trump was obviously being hyperbolic here, but his claim was inaccurate regardless. \"Chain migration,\" also known as family reunification, does not allow immigrants to sponsor mere acquaintances or distant relatives to immigrate to the United States, much less bring such people into the country at the same time as them. Citizens are allowed to sponsor spouses, children, parents and siblings for permanent residency. (We won\\'t get into all the specific rules and age requirements, which you can read here.) Permanent residents can sponsor spouses and unmarried children for permanent residency. Through the \"chain\" process, it is possible for the admission of one immigrant to eventually result in distant family members being admitted. (An immigrant could become a citizen and bring in her husband, who could become a citizen and bring in his parents, who could become citizens and bring in their siblings, and so on.) But Trump\\'s suggestion that distant relatives are immediately welcomed into the country was inaccurate. Trump\\'s victory in Alabama. \"Look, Alabama is a place where my approval numbers are very good. I think I won by 42 points\". November 8 exchange with reporters before Marine One departure. \"I think I won by, I don\\'t know, a lot. Was it 42 points? Something like that\". November 9 interview with ABC 33/40 of Birmingham, Alabama. Facts First: Trump won Alabama by about 28 points in 2016, 62.1% to Hillary Clinton\\'s 34.4%. Here are the claims Trump made last week that we have previously fact checked in one of these weekly roundups:. Ukraine and impeachment. Biden and \"corruption\". \"We are looking for corruption. We\\'re giving hundreds of millions of dollars, and we\\'re looking for corruption. And all you have to do is take a look at Biden, and you\\'ll see tremendous corruption, because what he did is quid pro quo times 10.\" And: \"And the tape shows that Joe Biden is a crook. He\\'s 100 percent crooked. And the fake news, which is you and you, you don\\'t want to do anything about it\". November 8 exchange with reporters before Marine One departure. Facts First: The \"tape\" Trump was likely referring to does not show Biden acting corruptly. The video, from a 2018 Council on Foreign Relations event, is of Biden telling a story of how he used a threat to deny Ukraine a $1 billion loan guarantee to successfully pressure Ukrainian leaders to fire a chief prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was widely seen by the US government and its European allies to be ineffective in fighting corruption. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden. Impeachment and illegality. \"These people are bad people and it\\'s so bad what they do to our country. They rip the guts out of a country and it\\'s a shame, and they shouldn\\'t be allowed to do it, and people should stop. Maybe go to the Supreme Court, maybe, but they\\'ve got to stop it because we have a country to run. And these people in order to do things, are willing to do illegal acts. It\\'s an illegal act as far as I\\'m concerned\". November 6 campaign rally in Monroe, Louisiana. Facts First: Trump was vague here, but he had been talking about the whistleblower and Democrats\\' impeachment push. There is no evidence of illegality by either the whistleblower or the Democrats. The timing of Schiff\\'s comments. Trump claimed on three occasions that he had released the rough transcript of his call with Ukraine\\'s president after Schiff delivered his own account of the call, surprising Schiff, Trump claimed, who did not expect the document to be released. Facts First: Schiff made his comments about Trump\\'s call with Zelensky the day after Trump released the rough transcript, not before. (Before he started claiming that Schiff did not expect a transcript to be released, Trump had complained that Schiff did not read the transcript available to him.) The accuracy of the whistleblower. Trump claimed on four occasions that the whistleblower\\'s account of his call with Ukraine\\'s president was highly inaccurate. Facts First: The whistleblower\\'s account of the call has largely been proven accurate. In fact, the rough transcript released by Trump himself showed that the whistleblower\\'s three primary allegations about the call were correct or very close to correct. You can read a full fact check here. The whistleblower disappearing. Trump claimed on seven occasions that the whistleblower \"disappeared\" after Trump released the rough transcript of his phone call with Ukraine\\'s president. He also claimed three times that a second whistleblower \"disappeared.\" Facts First: There is no evidence that either the first whistleblower (who filed the complaint about Trump\\'s dealings with Ukraine) or the second whistleblower (whose lawyers say they have firsthand information corroborating claims made by the first whistleblower) are now somehow \"gone,\" let alone that they are \"gone\" because the first whistleblower was shown to be inaccurate. \"The whistleblowers have not vanished,\" Bradley Moss, a colleague of Mark Zaid, a lawyer for the two whistleblowers, said on Twitter. European countries and aid to Ukraine. Trump claimed again that \"all these other countries,\" like Germany, France and the United Kingdom, are not \"putting up money\" for Ukraine. Facts First: European countries have provided hundreds of millions of dollars\\' worth of assistance to Ukraine since Russia\\'s invasion in 2014. Zelensky acknowledged European \"help\" during his meeting with Trump at the United Nations in September, though he said the world\\'s efforts had been inadequate so far: \"And, I\\'m sorry, but we don\\'t need help; we need support. And we thank, thank everybody, thank all of the European countries; they each help us. But we also want to have more, more.\" You can read a full fact check here. Trump\\'s poll numbers. \"It was a perfect conversation with Ukraine\\'s president. So, we\\'re winning. Our poll numbers are way up\". November 4 interview with WKYT of Lexington, Kentucky. \"We are winning so big. My polls are the highest they\\'ve ever been.\" And: \"Just so you know, we have the highest poll numbers\". November 8 exchange with reporters before Marine One departure. \"My poll numbers are higher than they\\'ve been, ever\". November 8 interview with Fox 5 Atlanta. Facts First: There was no sign of a major increase in Trump\\'s poll numbers at the time. The day before he spoke here, he had a 41.2% approval rating and a 54.9% disapproval rating in FiveThirtyEight\\'s aggregate measure. That was a slight decline from 41.5% approval and 54.0% disapproval two weeks prior. Trump might be able to point to an improvement in a particular poll or with a particular demographic, but there was no apparent basis for his sweeping statement. Economy and energy. \"In the meantime, we\\'ve got the best markets we\\'ve ever had, stock markets. We have the best unemployment numbers we\\'ve ever had\". November 8 exchange with reporters before Marine One departure. Facts First: The unemployment rates for some particular demographic groups are at their lowest levels \"ever,\" but the overall rate is not, though it is indeed impressively low. The overall rate was 3.6% in October, a 50-year low (if you ignore previous months in Trump\\'s presidency when it was slightly lower than 3.6%), but well above the record 2.5% set in 1953. Louisiana auto insurance. \"Car insurance is the highest in the country\". November 6 interview with Moon Griffon of KPEL 96.5. \". your car insurance is the highest in the world.\" And: \"We have the highest car insurance in the entire nation by far. Some people call it auto insurance, call it whatever the heck you want. You have the highest in the country. \". November 6 rally in Monroe, Louisiana. Facts First: Louisiana has the second-highest average annual car insurance premiums in the country, not the highest, according to Insure.com rankings regularly cited by Louisiana news outlets. Michigan has ranked first for six consecutive years, Louisiana second for three consecutive years. According to Insure.com, the average Michigan premium for 2019 was $2,611; the average Louisiana premium was $2,298. The national average was $1,457. \"We ended the war on American energy. We\\'re now the largest producer of energy anywhere in the world by far\". November 4 campaign rally in Lexington, Kentucky. Facts First: The US has not just \"now\" become the world\\'s top energy producer, and it did not achieve this status because of Trump\\'s policies: it took the top spot in 2012, under the very administration he has accused of perpetuating this \"war on American energy\", according to the US government\\'s Energy Information Administration. The US became the top producer of crude oil in particular during Trump\\'s tenure. \"Clean coal\". \"And we ended the war on beautiful, clean coal\". November 4 campaign rally in Lexington, Kentucky. Facts First: Nothing about coal is \"clean.\" \"Clean coal\" is an industry term for particular technologies that attempt to reduce the many environmental harms caused by coal, a particularly dirty source of power. The term is not meant to be used to broadly describe coal itself, though that is what Trump generally does. The Cameron LNG plant in Louisiana. \"I was at the opening of the $10 billion Cameron LNG export facility in Hackberry, Louisiana, employing thousands and thousands of Louisiana workers. They couldn\\'t get their permits for years. I got them real fast. I said, \\'How long?\\' I said, \\'Let\\'s go get them that permit.\\' For years and years they tried to get those permits, they couldn\\'t get them. I got them very fast and we cut a ribbon a couple of months ago\". November 6 campaign rally in Monroe, Louisiana. Facts First: The permits for the facility Trump visited in May were granted by the Obama administration. The company says on its website: \"The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission authorized the project in June 2014.\" The company confirmed to FactCheck.org: \"You are correct, Cameron LNG was approved in 2014.\" The facility made its first shipment in late May. Democrats and undocumented immigrants. \"They want to give illegal aliens free health care, free education, more advantages than our own citizens have, and more benefits than our own military gets\". November 4 campaign rally in Lexington, Kentucky. Facts First: There is no apparent basis for this claim. Some Democrats want to give undocumented immigrants the same access to health care and other programs that citizens have, not more. It was not clear who Trump was talking about when he referred to \"our own military.\" He repeatedly claimed during the presidential election that undocumented immigrants were being treated better than veterans; a Washington Post fact check concluded that this claim was \"absurd.\" Mexican soldiers and the border. \"We have 27,000 Mexican soldiers on our border, policing our border. \". November 4 campaign rally in Lexington, Kentucky. Facts First: Mexico has deployed around 27,000 troops, but Trump exaggerated how many are being stationed near the US border in particular. CNN reported https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/20/americas/mexico-border-wall-trump/index.html on November 2: \"Nearly 15,000 troops are deployed to Mexico\\'s northern border, where they\\'ve set up 20 checkpoints, Mexican Defense Minister Luis Cresencio Sandoval said last week at a press briefing on the country\\'s security strategy. At the southern border, 12,000 troops are deployed and have set up 21 checkpoints.\" Acting US Customs and Border Protection commissioner Mark Morgan has offered similar numbers, telling reporters in September that 10,000 of approximately 25,000 troops were on Mexico\\'s own southern border. https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-cbp-acting-commissioner-mark-morgan/. Democrats and borders. \"Democrats want open borders\". November 4 campaign rally in Lexington, Kentucky. but the Democrats, think of it. They want open borders, which means crime.\" And: \"How do you like having an open border with Mexico? Do you like that?\". November 6 campaign rally in Monroe, Louisiana. Facts First: Even 2020 Democratic presidential candidates who advocate the decriminalization of the act of illegally entering the country, such as Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro, do not support completely unrestricted migration, as Trump suggests. Democrats, immigrants and cars. \"I jokingly said once, \\'Rolls-Royces, every illegal immigrant gets a Rolls-Royce,\\' and the media said, \\'Donald Trump exaggerated. He said they all get Rolls-Royces. This is a lie.\\' These people are the worst\". November 8 speech to Black Voices for Trump. Facts First: That is not exactly what happened. Trump did make a joke at a 2018 campaign rally in Arizona about Democrats wanting to give undocumented immigrants a free Rolls-Royce, but then, at a rally the next day in Nevada, he made a non-joking claim that Democrats want to \"give them cars.\" He continued to joke about a Rolls-Royce in particular, but he was challenged on the assertion of fact. He said in Nevada: \"They want to open your borders, let people in, illegally. And then they want to pay for those people for health care, for education. They want to give them cars, they want to give them driver\\'s licenses. I said last night, we did a great, we did a great, great rally in Arizona last night, and I said. I said last night, what kind of car will they supply them? Will it be a Rolls-Royce? Trade and China. Who is paying Trump\\'s tariffs on China. \"We\\'re taking in, right now, and you know, as a reporter of finance, you know what I\\'m saying. They\\'ve devalued their currency and they ate this tariff. We\\'re taking in billions of dollars in tariff money from China\". November 8 exchange with reporters before Marine One departure. \"The great Sonny Perdue: he\\'s given away a lot of the money from China. We take in the money from China, we hand it over to the farmers, right\". November 8 speech to Black Voices for Trump. \"They\\'re paying us billions and billions of dollars a year in tariff. And they\\'re eating it. We\\'re not paying, they\\'re paying\". November 9 interview with ABC 33/40 of Birmingham, Alabama. Facts First: A bevy of economic studies have found that Americans are bearing the overwhelming majority of the tariff costs, and Americans make the actual tariff payments. The history of tariffs on China. \"China\\'s doing poorly, as you know, but they\\'re paying us billions and billions and billions of dollars and they\\'ve never given us 10 cents before, billions of dollars\". November 4 campaign rally in Lexington, Kentucky. \"America is no longer for sale. Thanks to my tariffs, we\\'re taking in billions and billions of dollars from a country that never gave us 10 cents, China\". November 6 campaign rally in Monroe, Louisiana. \"There\\'s a difference on tariffs, but we\\'re going to always get tariffs. We never got anything. Just so you understand, China, forever, never paid us 10 cents. Now we have, literally, we will soon have, literally, hundreds of billions of dollars coming in from China. We never got anything from China\". November 9 exchange with reporters before Air Force One departure. Facts First: Again, these tariffs are paid by Americans. Aside from the question of who is paying, it\\'s not true that the Treasury has never received \"10 cents\" from tariffs on China. The US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries; FactCheck.org reported that the US generated, from such tariffs, an \"average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.\" Trump\\'s claim also ignores China\\'s hundreds of billions of dollars in purchases of US goods, more than $300 billion during Trump\\'s presidency alone. The US had generated over $36 billion from Trump\\'s new tariffs on China as of November 13, according to official data published by Customs and Border Protection. The trade deficit with China. \"Past administrations did nothing, as China looted our factories and stole up to $500 billion of American dollars. By the way, people can\\'t even believe it, not five hundred million\". November 4 campaign rally in Lexington, Kentucky. Facts First: Through 2018, there had never been a $500 billion trade deficit with China. The deficit was $381 billion last year when counting goods and services, $420 billion when counting goods alone. China\\'s economic performance. \"They actually do like me, but they don\\'t like me what I\\'m doing exactly to them. They\\'re having the worst year they\\'ve had in 57 years. \". November 6 campaign rally in Monroe, Louisiana. \"China very much wants to make a deal. They\\'re having the worst year they\\'ve had in 57 years\". November 9 exchange with reporters before Air Force One departure. \"China\\'s having the worst year they\\'ve had in 57 years. We\\'re having the best year we\\'ve ever had\". November 9 interview with ABC 33/40 of Birmingham, Alabama. Facts First: China\\'s second-quarter GDP growth of 6.2% and third-quarter GDP growth of 6% were its worst since 1992, 27 years ago. Trump has repeatedly made clear that he knows that 27 years is the reported figure, but he has added additional years for no apparent reason. Popularity and accomplishments. Approval among Republicans. On November 4, November 5 and November 9, Trump tweeted the exact same words: \"95% Approval Rating in the Republican Party. Facts First: Trump\\'s approval rating among Republicans is very high, regularly in the 80s and sometimes creeping into the 90s, but it has not been 95% in any recent major poll we could find. Trump was at 83% approval with Republicans in an Ipsos/Reuters poll conducted November 4-5, 88% in a Monmouth University poll conducted October 30-November 3, 74% with Republicans in a Washington Post-ABC News poll conducted from October 27-30, and 89% with Republicans in Gallup data gathered from October 14-31. Special elections in North Carolina. \"You know, we had a great election, a couple of weeks ago in North Carolina, we won two House seats. We were supposed to lose, probably both of them, and we won them by a lot\". November 4 campaign rally in Lexington, Kentucky. Facts First: The special elections in North Carolina were eight weeks prior to Trump\\'s comments here, not \"a couple.\" While the race in the 9th District was widely considered competitive, the race in the 3rd District, which Trump carried by about 24 percentage points in 2016, was expected by pollsters and analysts to be won easily by the Republican candidate, Greg Murphy. \"You know, I got them Choice, so they have now Choice\". November 6 interview with Moon Griffon of KPEL 96.5 Facts First: President Barack Obama signed the Choice program into law in 2014; in 2018, Trump signed another bill, the VA MISSION Act, that expanded and modified the Choice program. \"So, President Obama left Mitch and me and Rand, and all of us, he left 142 openings to the judges. You\\'re not supposed to allow any\". November 4 campaign rally in Lexington, Kentucky. \"And we were left by the previous administration 142 judges to fill. Can you imagine that? That\\'s. I thought they may have one. They may have none. I said, \\'How many?\\' \\'Sir, you have 142.\\' I said, \\'You have to be kidding. You have to be kidding. 142.\\'\". November 8 speech to Black Voices for Trump. Facts First: Trump exaggerated. According to Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution who tracks judicial appointments, there were 103 vacancies on district and appeals courts on Jan. 1, 2017, just before Trump took office, plus a vacancy on the Supreme Court. Trump is entitled to his opinion on what a president is \"supposed to\" do, but it is normal for presidents to leave some judicial vacancies to their successors. According to Wheeler, there were 53 vacancies on January 1, 2009, just before Obama took office; 80 vacancies on January 1, 2001, just before George W. Bush took office; 107 vacancies on January 1, 1993, just before Bill Clinton took office. \"I will always protect Medicare for our nation\\'s seniors. It\\'s going to be protected. What they\\'re doing is crazy and we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions, and we will also protect you with pre-existing physicians\". November 4 campaign rally in Lexington, Kentucky. \"We will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions\". November 6 rally in Monroe, Louisiana. Facts First: We usually don\\'t fact-check promises, but this one has already proved untrue. The Trump administration and congressional Republicans have repeatedly put forward bills and filed lawsuits that would weaken Obamacare\\'s protections for people with pre-existing conditions; Trump is currently supporting a Republican lawsuit that is seeking to declare all of Obamacare void, and he has not issued a plan to reinstate the law\\'s protections for people with pre-existing conditions if the suit succeeds. © 2019 Cable News Network.

       " 'Editor\\'s Note: SE Cupp is a CNN political commentator and the host of \"SE Cupp Unfiltered.\" The views expressed in this commentary are solely hers. View more opinion on CNN. (CNN) - It\\'s become the political buzzword over the past few years, increasingly used to describe the root cause of our divisions and our resentments: tribalism. The idea that Americans are more divided than ever, entrenched in ideological camps and unwilling to meet in the middle, is so pervasive that one hardly goes a single hour without hearing about it on a cable news show. Since 2016, numerous books by very smart people, including Jonah Goldberg, Amy Chua, Steve Kornacki, Stevan E. Hobfoll, Sarah Rose Cavanagh and others have been devoted to tracing, explaining or solving America\\'s tribalism. But is tribalism really to blame? It\\'s more complicated than that. Tribalism, after all, is part of our evolutionary DNA. The need to identify with a group, to belong and commune with like-minded people is not only biological, it\\'s what has helped motivate our desire for and devotion to all kinds of important cultural institutions, from organized religion to sports fandom. What isn\\'t natural, however, is the oversized importance we\\'re increasingly putting on politics. A popular exercise. Tribalism, of course, is a compelling argument, considering that we\\'ve reduced our political beliefs to untenable absolutisms, have sacrificed compromise and comity for purity and are subjecting each other to increasingly unproductive tests of loyalty. We are more and more defined not by our friends but our political enemies — collecting them like badges of honor. It was actually a question at a 2015 Democratic debate: \"Which enemy are you most proud of?\" None of the five candidates batted an eyelash, eagerly rattling off their political hit lists. Hillary Clinton was practically giddy: \"Well, in addition to the NRA,\" she said, \"the health insurance companies, the drug companies, the Iranians. Probably the Republicans.\" This election feels somehow even worse. Democratic frontrunner Joe Biden has been harassed by people in his own party for complimenting Republican lawmakers, for seeming to be congenial, for vowing to work across the aisle if elected. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders insist if you\\'re not as far to the left as they are, you\\'re lacking intestinal fortitude. And on the right, we all know how that goes. President Donald Trump and Republicans have decided that anyone not fully behind them is an enemy, and maybe isn\\'t even an American — the latter of which Trump alluded to in a series of racist tweets targeting four women lawmakers of color. That is tribalism by definition. But we can\\'t throw it completely under the bus or out with the bathwater. After all, we literally can\\'t live without it. Forming communities — even and especially ones based on strong loyalties and allegiances — is in our DNA. It\\'s what\\'s kept us alive for millions of years. As UCLA professor Matthew Lieberman wrote in his 2013 book, \"Social: Why Our Brains Are Wired to Connect,\" \"Mammals are more socially connected than reptiles, primates more than other mammals, and humans more than other primates. What this suggests is that becoming more socially connected is essential to our survival. In a sense, evolution has made bets at each step that the best way to make us more successful is to make us more social.\" Tribalism isn\\'t just political. The need for community, to belong to something, is one important reason two very powerful communities have thrived: organized religion and professional sports. Both communities are organized around intense allegiances, often with the explicit requirement that adherents reject and disavow competing entities. Few worshipers believe equally in the major tenets of Christianity and Judaism — that Jesus is both the Messiah and that he\\'s not. Almost no baseball fans root equally for the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox. That would be, well, sacrilegious. The \"us vs. them\" structure demanded of many religious and sports faithful is not only accepted within those contexts, but it\\'s used to justify some patently bad behavior, from taunting rivals and hooliganism at sports events, to bigotry, hate crimes and even wars in the name of religion. The tribalism in both, however, has inarguably helped their success in creating vast global communities across generations and geography; becoming important agents of change in breaking down civil rights, race and gender boundaries; and providing purpose and a sense of family for billions of people. The tribalism in today\\'s politics is similarly double-edged. On the plus side, one could argue political engagement has benefited from an intensified political environment. 2018 was the first year that more than 100 million Americans voted in a midterm election, for example. On the minus, it feels impossible to civilly discuss politics — or avoid it altogether — when tensions are so high. It infects every aspect of our culture, from award shows to football games, our favorite coffee and fast food. Political \"teams\" may build enthusiasm and loyalty, but they inherently pit American against American, citizen against immigrant, young against old, and so on. That, as we\\'ve seen, can lead some to vengeance and violence in defense of their political tribe. It seems like politics has surpassed sports and organized religion as the most defining part of our identity. Our politics has become synonymous with our values and our organizing life principle. Instead, politics really should merely be a mechanism to govern. It\\'s not just tribalism in politics that\\'s the problem — it\\'s our outsized belief in its significance in our lives. We\\'re spending more on political campaigns, moving to places where our political views are popular and, according to a new study in the American Journal of Political Science, our politics may even be overriding our morals. As Peter Hatemi, one of the study\\'s authors, explains: \"We will switch our moral compass depending on how it fits with what we believe politically.\" Our obsession with the presidency. Partly to blame is our increasing obsession with the American presidency as an embodiment of hope and change, to borrow a phrase. Long before former President Barack Obama was supposed to save the country from its many suffering ills, so too were Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson and George W. Bush. These were merely men — politicians, at that — but onto each of them was foisted a heavy mantle of expectation that was never going to be fully realized. The paternalism of the presidency was baked in from the get-go. George Washington recoiled at the notion of being called \"the father of his country\" in newspapers, and, as Thomas Fleming writes in \"The Intimate Lives of the Founding Fathers,\" Washington did \"his utmost to avoid acknowledging this tendency to view him as a demigod.\" But our view of the chief executive as a fatherly figure who is there to guide us and care for us only grew. In conservative columnist George Will\\'s weighty new book, \"The Conservative Sensibility,\" he describes this as the \"infantilization of the public.\" He recalls a 1992 town hall-style debate featuring Bill Clinton, George H. W. Bush and Ross Perot, where an audience member asked, \"How can we, as symbolically the children of the future president, expect. you to meet our needs, the needs in housing and in crime and you name it?\" The American president, it is believed, must solve all our problems, both complex and mundane. He or she must reflect to us our idealized best selves and represent all we hope to become as a nation over the next four years. Whether we seek a Republican or a Democrat, a strong man or a caretaker, a traditionalist or a progressive, we truly believe we can find and deserve the Aaron Sorkin version of a president — a leader who is omnipresent in our lives and reflective of our values. Demystifying the persona of the presidency. In reality, the president has very little to do with our day-to-day challenges. The most influential people in our daily lives likely run our schools, our municipalities, our health, safety and sanitation boards. Most of us couldn\\'t name any one of those people. The election of President Donald Trump amped up our presidential cult of personality to 11. With no political record and a campaign of personal attacks and fear-mongering, Trump wasn\\'t elected to \"do politics\" or solve problems, but to mirror to his supporters the image of a forgotten man and all his grievances. How we unwind our long obsession with the presidency is complicated, and in some ways, like putting toothpaste back in the tube. But an essential part of deemphasizing the role of politics in our private lives is demystifying the persona of the president. A pretty good year to be alive. Now, I know it might feel like we\\'re at a crisis point in America — we are, among other things, contemplating impeaching our president. But while you might not know it from watching the news or reading the headlines, 2019 is a pretty good time to be alive. By nearly every metric of human well-being, the world around us is a much better place than it was a century or two ago. As Max Roser, an Oxford University economist, writes in \"The Short History of Global Living Conditions and Why It Matters That We Know It,\" we\\'re freer, more democratic, healthier, richer, better educated and more literate than we ever have been. And yet, especially in high-income Western countries like the United States, we\\'ve never been more stressed or felt more anxious. According to a recent survey, a scant 6% of people in the United States said things were getting better when asked, \"All things considered, do you think the world is getting better or worse?\" It\\'s no wonder, under those conditions, that we\\'ve become more divided, angry at our neighbors and resentful of others. Investing in our communities. But there\\'s reason to believe change is possible. And it\\'s important that we start looking inward, to our own communities. Over the past half-century, we dreamed big, looking outward to the horizons to expand our global opportunities and connectivity. That was a good thing, but in doing so we often ignored our own backyards. Instead of marching on Washington, imagine marching on your town square for smaller class rooms, cleaner water, less crime. Instead of tweeting about Trump or House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, what about doing some community service or volunteer work. Instead of teaching our kids to parrot our political views, let\\'s teach them civic engagement and how to make small differences in their own communities. If our political identities are how we build our own individual community, how we weed out friends from foes, how we judge each other above all other things, the logical conclusion is an America that sees politics as religion, that justifies intolerance and exclusion as virtue and righteousness, that rationalizes patently bad behavior in the name of a cause. We can continue to blame tribalism for our anger and division, but it\\'s an important part of our evolutionary makeup and a survival skill we\\'re not likely to ditch any time soon. The problem isn\\'t that we\\'re too tribal — it\\'s that we\\'ve let politics replace community. © 2019 Cable News Network. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

       " '(CNN) - A South African safari took a tragic turn Sunday when a giraffe was struck by a car and fell on another passing vehicle in Kruger National Park. The vehicle that hit the giraffe held 13 visitors passing through the park on their way to a rest camp. After being struck, the giraffe fell on an oncoming tourist rental vehicle driven by a Swiss national. The collision killed the giraffe and left the driver seriously injured. He later died in the hospital as a result of his injuries. Giraffes are typically between 14 feet to 19 feet tall and can weigh up to 2,800 pounds. The collision significantly damaged both cars involved. The park has urged visitors in a statement to be alert when driving through the park, reminding them to watch for all kinds of animals and give the animals right of way. \"We are approaching the festive season in a month\\'s time and encourage visitors to plan their trips between gates and camps so as to eliminate the need to hurry, please also exercise caution as the wildlife has no concept of traffic rules,\" the park said in a statement.

       " 'Editor\\'s Note: The following story has spoilers about the film \"Last Christmas.\" (CNN) - \"Last Christmas\" is based on the famous Wham! holiday song, but the film has a decided twist that has audiences buzzing. Director Paul Feig and producer David Livingstone talked to The Hollywood Reporter about that and more regarding the movie which stars Emilia Clarke and Henry Golding. Clarke plays Kate, a woman who is having a bit of a rough time and who is a heart transplant patient. She meets Golding\\'s character Tom, who takes her on a tour of the city and implores her to \"Look up\" as a way of getting away from distractions and really being present in life. Livingstone told THR he came up with the idea for the film when faced with the challenge of introducing something new into the already well-worn trope of holiday films. \"I thought the biggest thing I can think of is the song \\'Last Christmas,\\'\" he said. \"That\\'s the one thing that happens every Christmas, particularly in the UK. George Michael\\'s our Stevie Wonder, really, where you just go, \\'Oh, my god, Christmas has arrived. It\\'s \\'Last Christmas. George Michael was one half of the duo Wham! and sings the song \"Last Christmas\" which he also wrote. Livingstone said he had approached Michael about working together on the project and the singer wanted Emma Thompson to write the script. It all was put on hold, Livingstone said, after Michael\\'s death in 2016 and Thompson\\'s busy schedule. But it all came together after Livingstone and Thompson ran into each other at an awards ceremony. \"We were both backstage and I said, \\'We should really do something, Emma. And she said, \\'Let\\'s do Last Christmas. Let\\'s make it happen,\\'\" he said. \"So we did. She wrote the beautiful script.\" Audiences learn at the end that Golding\\'s Tom actually died and was the heart donor who saved Clarke\\'s Kate. It\\'s a literal interpretation of the song\\'s line \"Last Christmas, I gave you my heart.\" Director Paul Feig told THR the ending helped hook him. \"I like when movies surprise you and things are unexpected but in very emotional ways, something that affects you so deeply and connects you even more to the characters and makes their journey become even more clear,\" he said. Feig also talked to Vulture about wanting to go beyond just a typical \"girl meets boy\" film. \"None of us ever. I know I definitely didn\\'t want to, and Emma Thompson didn\\'t want to, and Emilia didn\\'t either, want to make a movie about, you know, a woman being saved by a man,\" he said. © 2019 Cable News Network.

       " '(CNN) - Other: A version of this story appears in CNN\\'s Impeachment Watch newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. Diplomat Bill Taylor on Wednesday played the role of the unimpeachable truth-telling Vietnam vet in Congress that a lot of people thought Robert Mueller would play. Taylor, the top official at the US Embassy in Ukraine, joined State Department official George Kent as the leadoff witnesses in public impeachment hearings to tell a story that\\'s already known. He was credible. While Mueller\\'s sometimes obtuse and muddled delivery did nothing to drive home the conclusions of the Russia report, Taylor brought life and conviction to his retelling of events, which led him to accuse his bosses of using badly needed military aid to force the Ukrainian government into US politics. He added in some new information. Taylor expanded his earlier testimony to include the story of an aide who overheard Trump ask US Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland over the telephone on July 26 about whether the Ukrainians would undertake investigations the US wanted. Just the facts (as he heard them). That\\'s far from firsthand information, but Taylor didn\\'t try to embellish. He refused to speculate, but he also insisted that he knew what he knew. Taylor was a George W. Bush administration official, and someone the Trump administration brought out of retirement. Along with the moral authority of his years of service, his testimony felt credible when he said the behavior he witnessed was not normal or OK. (His radio-worthy voice didn\\'t hurt, either.) No screaming and yelling. There were no angry back-and-forths with Republicans because he and Kent stayed in their lanes and left the pontificating to the politicians. Taylor even managed to share a smile and a laugh with Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, Republicans\\' self-appointed attack dog at these hearings. That\\'s my big takeaway after watching. Read and listen to some other thoughts here:. Impeachment Watch podcast real-time analysis with David Chalian, Carrie Cordero and Molly Ball. Most important takeaways from the first day of public impeachment hearings, by Chris Cillizza. Republicans shrug off impeachment hearings as boring, by Kevin Liptak. All of CNN\\'s hearing coverage is here. Jordan\\'s reply: The aid went through. Republicans pushed back against the testimony from Taylor and Kent. They argue the White House phone call doesn\\'t show pressure on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky despite President Donald Trump\\'s power over him, and because White House staffers, for the most part, are refusing to cooperate with subpoenas, it may be hard for investigators to fill in those gaps. Main theme of the defense. Jordan\\'s arguments against impeachment boiled down, very simply, to the fact that the aid was ultimately unfrozen and there is no investigation. In his telling, this becomes a story of a heroic Trump taking a chance with military aid on a young new leader standing up to Russia. A preview of coming impeachment hearings. Jordan again: \"The next few weeks we\\'re going to have more witnesses like today that the Democrats will parade in here and all going to say this. So-and-so said such and such to so-and-so and therefore, we got to impeach the President.\" Aid was released. But after whistleblower complaint. The reality is that the Ukraine aid was released just as everything was blowing up around the whistleblower complaint. Our timeline had gotten a bit hard to follow, so today I shrank it down to the key moments that explain the accusations against Trump. August 12. Whistleblower files complaint. August 29. Ukraine raises concerns about the aid. September 1. Sondland delivers ultimatum; Taylor raises concerns about Ukraine aid. September 9. Inspector general informs Congress of whistleblower complaint, and concerns from Taylor come to a head. September 12. Ukraine is informed that military aid is unfrozen; CNN interview with Zelensky is off. Trump confused by report of call with Sondland. During a White House news conference with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the hearing Wednesday, Trump bristled at being asked about the impeachment hearings. Specifically he responded on the new information we learned today: that Taylor said an aide had overheard Trump talking by phone to Sondland about Ukraine. Trump said he doesn\\'t recall it. \"I never heard this,\" he said, adding that it sounds like \"more secondhand information.\" Secret ballot in the Senate. The House is where the action is, but attention is already drifting to the Senate, which will have to conduct a trial if the House votes to impeach. Juleanna Glover is an anti-Trump Republican and she suggests an elegant solution in Politico, that senators use a secret ballot. She argues there is precedent for secret ballots in particularly tough votes on Capitol Hill, and there have been many stories about Republican senators being cowed by Trump. In secret, Glover argues, senators could vote their minds. And that\\'s exactly why Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell probably wouldn\\'t allow it. It would take a handful of Republicans to side with Democrats to make it happen, although Democrats aren\\'t talking about this either. What\\'s coming next. • White House may release transcript of April phone call between Trump and Zelensky. • Marie Yovanovitch, former US ambassador to Ukraine, testifies in public. • Taylor aide David Holmes testifies behind closed doors. • Mark Sandy, Office of Management and Budget official, testifies behind closed doors. What are we doing here. The President has invited foreign powers to interfere in the US presidential election. Democrats want to impeach him for it. It is a crossroads for the American system of government as the President tries to change what\\'s acceptable for US politicians.

       " '(CNN) - The recanvass of the Kentucky governor\\'s race results is officially underway. In a fight to keep his job, Republican Gov. Matt Bevin requested that all 120 counties recheck results from last Tuesday\\'s election, which showed him trailing Democratic state Attorney General Andy Beshear by more than 5,000 votes. The counties certified the vote last Friday, confirming Beshear\\'s lead. Results from the recanvass are expected Thursday afternoon, according to Lillie Ruschell, communications director for the Kentucky secretary of state. The office expects to make an announcement once the recanvass is complete. Kentucky law does not allow for a recount in a gubernatorial general election, but a campaign may request a recanvass of the votes with the secretary of state. There is no threshold or margin requirement for a recanvass, which began Thursday morning. \"It\\'s not likely to change a lot numerically, but you have to go through this as a first step. to make sure the numbers that were written down and communicated are accurate,\" Bevin told CNN affiliate WKYT. He said his office is also preparing for Beshear to assume the governorship. \"There are very good odds, he could be the next governor, no question about it,\" Bevin said. \"Right now, he is numerically ahead and would seemingly be the next governor, and if that is corroborated and held up through this process, I\\'ll be his number one cheerleader.\" Unlike a standard recount of votes, a recanvass is a reprint of the receipts from voting machines to check for reporting or clerical errors. After ballots are scanned, the machine tabulates those votes and prints out a receipt with the total. During the recanvass, those receipts will be reprinted and checked again to make sure they were reported properly. It\\'s not uncommon for some clerical errors to occur during the initial vote tabulation. Representatives from both political parties and the media are allowed to be present for the recanvass. Should Bevin want to pursue further action, he would have to cite specific evidence with the state\\'s election board after they have certified the results on November 25. The state\\'s General Assembly could then authorize a board of eight randomly-selected legislators to review the evidence and hear depositions. That board would make a recommendation to the full Assembly for possible further action. Asked if he is considering further action beyond a recanvass, Bevin demurred. \"I\\'m not at this point. I have to figure out at this point, let\\'s take it one day at a time,\" he said. © 2019 Cable News Network. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Listen to CNN (low-bandwidth usage).

       " 'Washington (CNN) - The Trump administration\\'s nominee to lead the Federal Emergency Management Agency repeatedly said Thursday he doesn\\'t know the reasons behind climate change, despite his agency often being in the position of responding to the crisis\\' impacts. The nominee, Pete Gaynor, made the comments when he was asked at his confirmation hearing whether climate change is real. \"The climate has changed. I cannot attribute the scientific reasons why,\" Gaynor, currently FEMA\\'s deputy administrator, said when questioned by Sen. Tom Carper, a Democrat from Delaware. Gaynor explained at the hearing that he realizes hurricanes have become \"more frequent, more intense, closer together\" but that he cannot explain why because he is \"not a scientist.\" \"I\\'m not either,\" Carper responded. \"There are a lot of scientists in the world and they are pretty much in unanimity in what\\'s going on. What do you think is going on?\" \"I don\\'t know, sir,\" Gaynor said. \"That\\'s not a very good answer,\" Carper told him. Gaynor explained that his job is about \"preparing for and responding to disasters, no matter the cause.\" Scientists say hurricanes are becoming more powerful and devastating because of rising sea levels and temperatures, and by causing them to slow down and stall, as did Hurricane Dorian, which sat over the Bahamas earlier this year. There is broad consensus in the scientific community that human activities are releasing large amounts of carbon dioxide into the environment, which is trapping heat inside the atmosphere. The resulting climate changes will become dire if not acted in in coming years, they warn. While FEMA does not have a mission to combat climate change directly, it does respond to the natural disasters that experts say have been made worse because of climate change. Recent years have brought devastating hurricanes, wildfires and flooding to the US. © 2019 Cable News Network. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

       " 'Washington (CNN) - Dramatic new disclosures on Day 1 of the House impeachment hearings painted an incriminating picture of Donald Trump as a President instinctively willing to sacrifice America\\'s interests for his own. In the most critical step so far in the investigation into Trump\\'s alleged scheme to coerce Ukraine\\'s help for his reelection campaign, Democrats posed a question to every US citizen at the core of this dark national chapter. \"If this is not impeachable conduct, what is?\" House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, asked, arguing that the republic\\'s values and the concept of an accountable presidency were at stake for future generations. Using as their first witnesses two conscientious, apolitical diplomats who devoted their lives to national service, Democrats built a foundation for a case that Trump abused his far greater power. It is a story certain to play out again and again in the coming weeks as lawmakers contemplate whether to deal Trump the historic stigma of being only the third president to be impeached. In Wednesday\\'s most striking moment, the top US diplomat in Ukraine, Bill Taylor, revealed a previously undisclosed call between Trump and the US Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland that took place a day after Trump\\'s notorious talk with Ukraine\\'s President in July. He said that an aide, who heard the call on a mobile phone while in a restaurant in a scenario that raised national security concerns, reported that Trump asked Sondland about \"the investigations\" into former Vice President Joe Biden that he had requested from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Trump told reporters on Wednesday he had no memory of the event. \"I know nothing about that. First time I heard it,\" Trump said at the White House. \"In any event, it\\'s more secondhand information. I don\\'t recall it, not at all, not even a little bit.\" The new detail deals a blow to Republican claims that there is no evidence of any direct link between Trump and an attempt to pressure Ukraine into targeting Biden. Since Trump has previously claimed of Sondland: \"I hardly know the gentleman\" the testimony also poked new holes in Trump\\'s denials. And it raised already extreme pressure on Sondland himself, who is due to testify next week. Taylor and his colleague George Kent, the deputy assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian Affairs, also provided testimony to back up the theory that Trump demanded political dirt from on Biden. In a political world ruled by fact and where polarized differences still allowed dispassionate debate, Trump\\'s position immeasurably worsened over an intense day of testimony. But his Republican allies, who mostly defended him with bluster, conservative media conspiracy theories and process complaints, underscored the daunting Democratic task ahead. The GOP\\'s attack dogs may have succeeded in complicating what Democrats hoped would be an easy-to-understand case that could convince the public of Trump\\'s malfeasance in a way that former special counsel Robert Mueller\\'s voluminous Russia report could not. Democrats will need to do more to crystallize all the coming testimony in a compelling and concise case that could change the political winds. No collapse evident yet in Trump\\'s firewall. If Democrats are to pull off a longshot bid to oust Trump, they need to break the dam of GOP support built up by a President who has an extraordinary hold on his party. Their longer-term goal of so damaging Trump through impeachment that his 2020 race becomes a fool\\'s errand may be a more feasible objective. At the outset of the hearings, there is no sign yet of a collapse in Trump\\'s Republican support. Unlike in the Richard Nixon era, a battery of conservative media pundits, talk radio hosts and Trump supporters on Fox News prime time have the wattage to rally GOP voters and keep Trump\\'s Washington coalition intact. Republican senators in any subsequent impeachment trial may however be a little more impervious to pressure than Trump\\'s crew in the House, especially those who face tough reelection races in swing states. Still, one of Trump\\'s most committed champions, Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, claimed Democrats\\' opening gambit was a bust. \"I think it is a sad chapter for the country but frankly a good day for the facts and the President of the United States,\" he said. At times however, the GOP counterattack misfired badly. At one point, Republican counsel Stephen Castor, who struggled to establish a consistent line of questioning, caused Taylor to burst out laughing when he tried to get him to agree that Trump personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani\\'s backdoor Ukraine policy channel was not \"as outlandish as it could be.\" \"It\\'s not as outlandish as it could be, I agree,\" Taylor said. It could be days before it becomes clear how the Washington drama is playing in the nation as a whole. But some voters in the crucial 2020 swing district of Maricopa County in Arizona did not like what they heard of the President\\'s conduct. \"I no longer recognize the Republican Party of my youth,\" said 38-year-old Carly Rebuck, who did not vote for Trump last time and thinks he should be impeached. Boyce O\\'Brien, a registered Republican who has lived in Phoenix for 22 years, also decried the GOP. \"Where are those Christian Republicans when it comes to integrity? They\\'ve ignored what this President has done,\" he told CNN\\'s Kyung Lah. But Kent Jeffers, a visiting Wisconsinite, said the hearings won\\'t shake his support for Trump. \"It\\'s a constant block of everything President Trump is trying to do. OK, Mueller didn\\'t get him. Other people didn\\'t get him. Now we need to find another narrative. I think everyone\\'s numb to it,\" Jeffers said. Trump \\'cares more about Biden\\' than Ukraine. The Democratic plan over the next two weeks is to keep up a drumbeat of testimony designed to prove that Trump hijacked America\\'s foreign policy interests for venal political gain. This scheme allegedly ignored the desperation of a struggling democracy fighting a Russian invasion that needed $400 million in held-up US military aid to survive. As Taylor, paraphrasing a comment by Sondland, put it: Trump \"cares more about the investigations of Biden\" than Ukraine. Wednesday was a day of contrasts. Taylor and his bow-tied colleague Kent emerged from the obscurity of decades of service in the Foreign Service to put on a show of duty and restraint that marked a sharp distinction from the hyper-partisan hothouse in the House hearing room. A Vietnam War veteran who went against his better judgment to go back to Kiev to replace Marie \"Masha\" Yovanovitch, Taylor repeatedly reminded lawmakers he had no political motivation. Kent and Taylor were both the epitome of the post-World War II diplomatic consensus that sees America\\'s interests best advanced through global leadership and transatlantic alliances. \"Europe\\'s security and prosperity contributed to our security and prosperity,\" Kent said. But this is a conventional, establishment worldview that Trump, with his \"America First\" outlook and mistrust of allies he sees as freeloaders, wants to destroy. Rep. Devin Nunes, a staunch Trump ally, branded both witnesses as denizens of a \"politicized bureaucracy\" that had caused immense damage to Americans\\' faith in government. \"Elements of the civil service have decided that they, not the President, are really in charge,\" the California Republican said. As if to underline the gulf in the rival visions of America\\'s global role, Trump appeared at a news conference with Turkish strongman President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan as the hearing ended. The President heaped praise on Erdoğan, whose forces assaulted America\\'s Kurdish allies in a recent operation in Syria greenlit by Trump. And in another affront to traditional US values, Trump joked about Erdoğan\\'s friendly press pack. Journalists have been rounded up and imprisoned in droves in Turkey. For Schiff, the next few weeks are about proving that Trump\\'s values and behavior are inconsistent with the expectations of a president. In his closing statement, he said the process was about \"whether we\\'re prepared to accept in the presence of the United States a situation where the President, for their own personal or political benefit can condition military aid, diplomatic meetings or any other performance of an official act in order to get help in their reelection.\" © 2019 Cable News Network.

The pregnant social media star, who cannot be named under German privacy law, had 100,000 Instagram followers, Rehaag told CNN. She used the social media platform to advertise her services between 2017 and April 2019, charging between 300 and 450 Euros ($330 to $495) for the injections, which she initially carried out in her living room. Later, treatments were carried out in hotel suites \"where one room was used as a treatment room and the other as a waiting room for clients,\" Rehaag said. \"The court also learned that some treatments were carried out in a private room at discotheques.\" He added: \"The presiding judge said that the term \\'hygiene ordinance\\' was an unknown to the woman. Basic measures in this area which are absolutely necessary and unavoidable have been disregarded here, such as wearing gloves, wearing a surgical mask, using disinfectants.\" The court heard of at least 35 cases, and prosecutors said there are probably more. \"Many of her clients later complained of complications after their procedures, which ranged from swelling and dents,\\'\\' Rehaag said. The woman\\'s gross payment was estimated to be about $500,000. The influencer was also ordered to repay around $73,800 in unpaid taxes. She has been temporarily released from prison to give birth before serving the rest of her sentence, Rehaag confirmed.

Post is partnering with Hostess to turn the 90-year-old treat into a cereal that will be available nationwide in late December. The taste of Twinkies Cereal \"replicates the distinctive taste and familiar oblong shape\" of the snack cake, according to a press release. Josh Jans, Post\\'s brand manager of cereal partnerships, said the company conducted \"multiple consumer tests\" to nail down the sweet flavor of Twinkies, which are cream-filled yellow sponge cakes. \"We think fans will find that it not only tastes great with milk but also outside the bowl,\" he added. Twinkies are one of the country\\'s oldest and most recognizable snacks. Created during the Great Depression, Twinkies were in production until 2012 when Hostess filed for bankruptcy and temporarily shuttered after struggling with high cost structures and slowing demand. The company was bought by private equity firms and reemerged with a smaller headcount called Hostess Brands. Gores Group bought a majority stake for $725 million in July 2016.

       " 'Washington (CNN) - Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, two of President Donald Trump\\'s senior advisers, threw a book party on the evening of the first public impeachment hearings. It was an invite-only celebration for Ivanka Trump\\'s older brother, Don Jr., in honor of his new book, \"Triggered\" which debuted as No. 1 on The New York Times bestselling list. The party, which appeared to be for 50 or so guests, was held at the Top of the Hay, a posh, penthouse-level event space that typically rents for thousands of dollars, at the Hay-Adams Hotel, overlooking the White House. The guests, according to Instagram photos, included White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, as well as two new members of the White House anti-impeachment messaging team, former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi and former Treasury Department spokesman Tony Sayegh. In one photograph from the party, Bondi and State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus flank Ivanka Trump, all three coincidentally wearing pink suits. Also present for the festivities was Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, who just hours before the party was one of the featured Republican lawmakers at the impeachment hearings, grilling the top US diplomat in Kiev, Ambassador Bill Taylor. Other staunch Trump supporters partook in the festivities feting Trump Jr., including Republican Reps. Kevin McCarthy, Matt Gaetz and Mark Meadows, Sebastian Gorka, Sen.

Kushner played host at the event, toasting his brother-in-law, saying of his new book,\"(it\\'s) driving everyone crazy, which is Don\\'s specialty,\" in videos posted by Gorka and Falwell Jr. Trump Jr., with girlfriend Kimberly Guilfoyle by his side, responded: \"You cannot turn off the genes, so I just gotta embrace what I am and go with it and it\\'s worked out well for me.\" In his remarks, Kushner noted that life in Washington for he and his wife, Ivanka, has been unusual. \"For Ivanka and myself, coming down to Washington it\\'s been definitely a unique experience. We joke that we don\\'t get paid for of this job, but having the friendship of all of you and getting the opportunity to meet all of you makes it an incredibly worthwhile experience,\" he said. Kushner also acknowledged \"Triggered\" hitting No. 1 on The New York Times bestseller list, something the President tweeted about late Wednesday night as well. Was just told that my son\\'s book, \"Triggered,\" is Number One on The New York Times Bestseller List. Congratulations Don!,\" Trump tweeted. © 2019 Cable News Network.

       " \"Editor's Note: Julia A. Minson is an associate professor of public policy at Harvard Kennedy School, where Charles A. Dorison is a doctoral candidate and Todd Rogers is a professor of public policy. The views expressed in this commentary are their own. View more opinion on CNN. (CNN) - What were you doing on January 20, 2017. Like many Americans, you may have tuned in to watch President Donald Trump give his inaugural address. Or, maybe like others, you may have avoided it entirely, for fear of how it would make you feel. As behavioral scientists aiming to understand what drives political division, we saw this as a perfect opportunity to conduct an experiment. Seconds after the address ended, we used an online platform to recruit over 200 Americans who had voted for Hillary Clinton to participate in a survey. We first asked the voters to predict how they expected to feel if they were to watch the 17-minute inauguration address (which most of them had avoided doing), by checking off which emotions they would experience and how strongly. We then asked them to watch the entire address and report how they actually felt by considering the same emotions again. A few hours and a collection of angry emails later, we had our results: It turns out, listening to Trump's inaugural address wasn't as bad an experience for them as the Clinton voters had predicted. While our participants may not have been persuaded by many of Trump's arguments, they ended up agreeing with more of his speech than they expected going in. Indeed, participants reported that the experience was better than expected 61% of the time, exactly as expected 11% of the time and worse than expected just 28% of the time. To us, this study suggested that political disagreement might not elicit as much negative emotion as people typically expect it to. It also provided a small window into how Americans could begin to bridge divides by exposing themselves to contrary political positions. Of course, one study was not enough to fully convince us. Maybe it was just something about this speech, or this day? Isn't it the case that any president has a team of professional writers crafting speeches that would have broad appeal? To test this possibility, in a new study we collected 15 arguments from Trump supporters and showed them to 400 liberal participants. Again, we found the same pattern: While the liberal participants didn't find the experience overall pleasant, it wasn't as negative as they expected going in. The majority of participants experienced stronger positive emotions and weaker negative ones than they expected. Still skeptical of our own results, we then conducted a follow-up study in which 200 liberals and 200 conservatives watched speeches by opposing-party senators (Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders). Here as well, listening to the other side turned out to be more tolerable than the partisans expected. Importantly, the result was true for both sides, liberals (watching Cruz) and conservatives (watching Sanders). A couple more variations later, with a new set of speeches and a few new batches of participants, we were convinced. The question was, why was this happening. Individuals tend to avoid information that contradicts their prior beliefs. This phenomenon, called selective exposure, plainly means that people choose to only expose themselves to content they expect to agree with. Think of your conservative uncle who only watches Fox News, or your liberal nephew who listens exclusively to NPR. In a recent study, conducted by researchers Jeremy Frimer, Linda Skitka and Matt Motyl, about two thirds of individuals preferred earning less money for study participation if it meant avoiding reading arguments opposing their beliefs. This, of course, can lead to concern that people form echo chambers, wherein like-minded citizens simply reiterate familiar and attractive positions. Our paper, recently published in the journal Cognition, suggests that such selective exposure partly relies on miscalibrated emotional predictions. People misjudge their emotions because they don't realize that they will actually agree with some of the ideas on the other side. Even in the Trump inauguration speech, Clinton voters found some content they agreed with. When individuals overestimate how painful listening to the other side will be, they tend to avoid this information more than they otherwise would if they were making accurate predictions. In fact, we find that simply teaching people about our research and thus recalibrating their emotional forecasts reduced selective exposure by up to a third. Liberal participants were more willing to listen to a speech by Cruz, and conservative participants were more willing to watch a speech by Sanders. And everyone was more willing to click on an opposing-party senator's website and learn more about his or her policy positions. Exposing ourselves to opposing views is no panacea. One rigorous experiment on Twitter demonstrated that encountering opposing opinions on social media may make things worse rather than better. However, our democracy requires us at a minimum to expose ourselves to a diversity of ideas. Doing so is a necessary, but not sufficient, precondition for effective civil discourse. In today's political environment, this can feel like a daunting task. But our research suggests a more hopeful outlook. Whether you're on the right or left, next time you encounter a headline from the other side, take the risk. It likely won't be as bad as you think. © 2019 Cable News Network.

       " '(CNN) - Three cows separated from their herd and swept away by Hurricane Dorian have been found miles from home in a national seashore park, a spokesman said. Dorian brought fierce winds, destructive tornadoes and heavy rain to North Carolina in September when it made landfall in the Outer Banks in North Carolina. During the storm, wild horses and cows were carried away by floodwaters from Cedar Island. Dozens of horses were swept to their deaths. The cows were missing until they were discovered around four miles away at Cape Lookout National Seashore park in Core Banks, according to B.G. Horvat, the park\\'s spokesman. Horvat told CNN he\\'s unsure how many cows were part of the herd and how many may have died from Dorian\\'s floodwaters. The cows were not wild, according to Horvat. He said they had caretakers in Cedar Island who looked after them, and the park is trying to get in touch with their owner. \"They likely got swept away from the same body of water as those wild horses,\" Horvat told CNN on Wednesday. \"These cows were just really lucky because they went through the same thing and they could have easily drowned.\" Horvat said the park\\'s superintendent told him that cows can swim but they aren\\'t the best at it. \"They will if they have to, and that\\'s what seems to be one of the most remarkable things about this story,\" he said. \"I think they were in the water just trying to keep their head afloat.\" One cow was spotted shortly after Dorian hit, while the other two were found about two weeks later by visitors. Horvat said the cows are grazing in the wild on the Core Banks and they\\'ve been able to survive from the sea grass or other vegetation. He said they might be drinking on the south side of the island, which has fresh water. © 2019 Cable News Network. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

       " '(CNN) - The House Intelligence Committee opened historic impeachment hearings Wednesday to investigate whether President Donald Trump (and his allies) abused his office in an attempt to strong-arm Ukraine into opening an inquiry into his political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden. I monitored the highly anticipated, and hugely high-stakes, hearing as it happened. Below, my thoughts on the biggest moments of the day. Adam Schiff appeals to history, and the future. Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff\\'s opening statement had a very clear message: These hearings aren\\'t about just Trump. They\\'re about how the presidency functions (and should function) within our democracy, and about the checks and balances between the legislative and executive branches built into the Constitution. \"Our answer to these questions will affect not only the future of this presidency, but the future of the presidency itself, and what kind of conduct or misconduct the American people may come to expect from their commander-in-chief,\" said Schiff at one point. At another, citing the Trump\\'s administration\\'s refusal to allow its senior officials to testify before Congress, Schiff said such a move \"is not what the Founders intended,\" adding: \"The prospects for further corruption and abuse of power, in this administration or another, will be exponentially increased.\" In closing, Schiff asked, \"Is that what Americans should now expect from their President? If this is not impeachable conduct, what is? Does the oath of office itself, requiring that our laws be faithfully executed, that our President defend a Constitution that balances the powers of its branches, setting ambition against ambition so that we become no monarchy, still have meaning? The goal of Schiff\\'s repeated invocations of history, he mentioned the Founders twice and the Constitution three times, was to cast these hearings less as a partisan effort directed at Trump and more as a necessary defense of the democratic principles on which the country was founded. This isn\\'t about Trump or even a particular political party, Schiff was saying. This is about how we want our government to work, and not work. It seems unlikely that Schiff\\'s appeal to history will sway many people on the committee. Even before he began speaking, Republicans had put signs behind the dais criticizing the proceedings. Devin Nunes turns it up to 11. If Schiff tried to ground the hearings in history, California Rep. Devin Nunes, the highest-ranking Republican on the Intelligence Committee, sought to go the gonzo route. He called the hearings a \"pitiful finale\" to Democratic attempts to overturn the results of the 2016 election. He described the closed-door testimony offered by Ukraine witnesses a \"cult-like atmosphere.\" He suggested that the whistleblower \"was known to have a bias against President Trump.\" He derided the \"impeachment sham.\" He called the proceedings a \"Star Chamber.\" He dismissed the investigation as a \"low-rent Ukrainian sequel\" to the Mueller investigation. Nowhere that I could tell did Nunes actually, you know, address the July 25 transcript between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Or the facts presented by the witnesses called by House investigators. Bill Taylor\\'s opening statement is a wow. Taylor, the top US official in Ukraine, delivered a tour-de-force opening statement, packed with details about the formation of an \"irregular\" channel (led by personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani) with Ukraine that often ran directly counter to his own regular channel and longstanding US policy in the region. Taylor also laid out an excruciatingly specific timeline of his interactions with, among others, National Security Adviser John Bolton, US Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland and top Ukrainian officials. In that timeline, he repeatedly made clear that there was a not-very-quiet understanding that military aid from the US to Ukraine was being withheld unless and until the country announced an investigation into Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian natural gas company where Hunter Biden, the former vice president\\'s son, sat on the board. Most stunningly, Taylor recounted an episode that he was told about only after his September 22 closed-door testimony involving Sondland. According to Taylor, Sondland met with a top aide to Zelensky on July 26, one day after the fateful call between Trump and Zelensky. Sondland then called Trump and informed him of the nature of the meeting and an aide to Taylor heard Trump ask of \"the investigations.\" Following that call, the Taylor aide asked Sondland what Trump\\'s thoughts were on Ukraine. Sondland replied that Trump cares more about the Biden investigation than anything else. Which, wow. The geopolitical impact of Trump\\'s approach to Ukraine. While the focus of Wednesday\\'s hearing, from members of Congress at least, is what Trump (and his allies) did in regard to Ukraine and the Bidens, both Taylor and George Kent, a State Department official, repeatedly expressed their concerns about the impact of withholding military aid to the country. Taylor noted that he had traveled to the Donbass region in eastern Ukraine and had seen, directly, the impact of the nearly $400 million in withheld American military aid for the country in its ongoing fight against Russian incursions. Kent, similarly, sought to emphasize how critical Ukraine, and America\\'s support for Ukraine, was in the ongoing efforts to limit Russia\\'s advancement in the region. (Russia annexed Crimea, a Ukrainian territory, in 2014.) The genuine concern expressed by Taylor and Kent is a startling reminder that the pressure campaign organized by the White House had, to these longtime diplomats\\' minds, real-world implications not just for Ukraine but for the United States\\' interests in the region, and specifically in its dealings with Russia. In short: This wasn\\'t just about Trump getting what he wanted on the Bidens from Ukraine. This had real reverberations in American geopolitics. Taylor says none of this was normal. One of Republicans\\' biggest talking points going into these impeachment hearings was that nothing Trump did in his call with Zelensky was outside the normal operating procedures of a President negotiating with a foreign leader. \"We do that all that time with foreign policy,\" acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said last month, adding, \"Get over it.\" Taylor was clear on Wednesday that he did not agree with the Republican view on this. \"It\\'s one thing to try to leverage a meeting in the White House,\" said Taylor. \"It\\'s another thing. I thought, to try to leverage security assistance. It\\'s much more alarming.\" Partisans will take the side that affirms their view. But remember that Taylor is a longtime diplomat serving under both Democratic and Republican presidents. And that Mulvaney is, well, not. Nunes pushed a debunked Ukraine conspiracy theory. Opening his questions to Kent and Taylor in the early afternoon, Nunes detailed a widely debunked conspiracy theory that, somehow, the Ukrainians were involved in working to aid Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton\\'s 2016 campaign and that the country might have possession of the hacked Democratic National Committee\\'s server. (The President brought up this same conspiracy theory during his July 25 call with Zelensky.) To be clear: There is no evidence that Ukraine played any role in the 2016 US presidential election. Kent said as much during his testimony, under oath, earlier on Wednesday. Former National Security Council Russia expert Fiona Hill said the same during her closed-door testimony to House investigators. And former White House homeland security adviser Tom Bossert summed it up to ABC\\'s George Stephanopoulos this way in late September:. \"It is completely debunked. I am deeply frustrated with what Giuliani and the legal team is doing and repeating that debunked theory to the president. It sticks in his mind when he hears it over and over again, and for clarity here, George, let me just again repeat that it has no validity.\" So, no, Devin Nunes. Republicans\\' main talking point: Yawn. There\\'s a very clear effort by prominent Republicans to paint this impeachment hearing as a big nothingburger. \"This sham hearing is not only boring, it is a colossal waste of taxpayer time & money,\" tweeted White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham. \"This is horribly boring. #Snoozefest,\" tweeted Eric Trump. And North Carolina Rep. Mark Meadows, a close White House ally, told CNN\\'s Lauren Fox: \"I don\\'t know about you but it\\'s hard for me to stay awake and listen to all of this.\" The similarity in language is, well, not an accident. It\\'s obvious that Republicans believe their best way to get through all of this is to say that it\\'s all boring and a bunch of details that only nerds care about. Will it work? For the base, yes. For the rest of the country? I doubt it. Jim Jordan showcases his patented interviewing style. House Republicans so value Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, and his ability to score points in congressional hearings, that they added him to the Intelligence Committee just days before Wednesday\\'s hearing. And Jordan did his thing. He spoke fast. (\"You\\'re their star witness?\" Jordan sarcastically asked Taylor. \"I\\'ve seen church prayer chains that are easier to understand than this. The goal of all of this, as it always is with Jordan, is to make witnesses look unsure and unsteady. (When you talk really fast and then push the witness to immediately respond in a single-word answer, it tends to have that effect.) Did it work with Taylor? There were a few \"ums and \"ahs\" from the ambassador, but he stuck to his story. Republicans say Ukraine never did what Trump asked, so. One of the main thrusts of the GOP argument against the testimony of Taylor and Kent is that, for all of their concerns about what Trump asked of Zelensky, the nearly $400 million in military aid was released in September, even without Ukraine making any public statement about its plans to investigate the Bidens. Jordan hit on the nothing-actually-happened line. As did Texas Rep. John Ratcliffe. As did New York Rep. Elise Stefanik. But context matters. Right around the time that the aid was released fully. September 11. Congress had begun to ask questions (on a bipartisan basis) about why the aid was being withheld. And there was already talk about a whistleblower complaint, which had been formally filed on August 11, alleging wrongdoing by Trump on that call with Zelensky among other things. That timing suggests that the argument being made by Jordan and other Republicans isn\\'t as conclusive as they want it to seem. © 2019 Cable News Network. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.

       " '(CNN) - There\\'s a 10-week-old puppy in Missouri with a tail growing out of his forehead. Yes, his forehead. No, it doesn\\'t wag. And, appropriately, his name is Narwhal. Well, his full name is \"Narwhal the Little Magical Furry Unicorn,\" according to dog rescue nonprofit organization Mac\\'s Mission, which took him in after he was discovered last Saturday. He was found in the freezing cold, with what appears to be the beginnings of frostbite on one paw. Unlike an actual narwhal whale, which has a protruding canine tooth that resembles a tusk, the tail on Narwhal\\'s forehead is short and stubby, sprouting right between his eyes, and flops from side to side when he plays. He has a normal tail, too, this one is just extra. Workers at Mac\\'s Mission, which specializes in special needs dogs who had been abused or born with defects, say he\\'s recovering quickly, with the frostbite healing. \"He seems completely healthy other than some usual puppy worms he got meds for,\" said the organization in a Facebook post. Vets took X-ray scans which showed the tail isn\\'t connected to anything. It and has no real use, as far as they can tell, but it also doesn\\'t cause him any pain and there\\'s no medical reason to remove it, so the forehead tail is here to stay. \"The unicorn face tail does not bother Narwhal and he never slows down just like any normal puppy,\" said the Facebook post. He was found with another dog, which rescue workers speculate may be his father. This older dog, who has been named Poppa Smurf, is a Daschund Terrier mix, so they assume Narwhal may have some Daschund in him as well. It\\'s not clear what happened to the two of them before they were discovered, but a spokesperson from Mac\\'s Mission told CNN Narwhal is from rural Missouri in the Midwest, and loves to play, and now, he has thousands of fans online, after his special tail catapulted him to internet fame. The rush of online attention has been \"crazy,\" the spokesperson, adding that the staff \"feel like we\\'re in a dream.\" He\\'s not yet ready for adoption, Mac\\'s Mission said online, but that hasn\\'t stopped Narwhal\\'s fans from wanting to take him home. The organization has already received over 50 adoption applications for him, a spokesperson told CNN. Narwhal will likely be listed for adoption once he\\'s older and has gone through more medical procedures like vaccinations. The staff say they also want to monitor his unicorn horn a little while longer to make sure it doesn\\'t grow or become a problem. \"Everyone is super interested in him,\" the spokesperson said — but \"we are hopeful they are seeing the other available dogs as well! © 2019 Cable News Network.

       " 'New York (CNN Business) - A version of this article first appeared in the \"Reliable Sources\" newsletter. You can sign up for free right here. I wanted to know what President Trump was hearing about day one of the televised impeachment hearings. So I decided to mute all my other TVs and just watch Fox News on Wednesday night. I heard White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham say that \"today was a joke.\" I heard Donald Trump Jr. say \"it\\'s insanity.\" I heard Jeff Sessions ask, \"Where\\'s the beef? Here\\'s how I would sum up everything I heard from Fox\\'s prime time hosts: Wednesday\\'s hearing was a bust. It was all just hearsay. It was a \"disaster\" for the Democrats and a \"great day\" for the Republicans. Impeachment is \"stupid.\" Impeachment is \"fake.\" There\\'s nothing impeachable here. There\\'s no reason to hold hearings. This inquiry needs to stop right now. The message was one-sided and overwhelming. Every host and practically every guest said the Republican tribe is winning and the Democrat tribe is losing. I\\'m sure the president loved watching every minute of it. That\\'s one of the reasons why this right-wing rhetoric matters so much, because it is reassuring and emboldening Trump. I decided to write it all down because of something that CNN\\'s Oliver Darcy wrote earlier in the day. \"Don\\'t expect viewers, listeners, and readers of right-wing media to walk away from Wednesday\\'s impeachment hearings with a different opinion of President Trump\\'s behavior,\" Darcy said. \"In fact, it\\'s possible they might be more convinced than ever that Trump did nothing wrong. Because right-wing media has largely, and unsurprisingly, focused on the moments in the hearing favorable to its preferred narrative.\" He was right. Here\\'s what Fox News viewers heard on Wednesday night. Tucker: \"MEDIA MELTDOWN\". On the OTHER cable news channels, 8 p.m. host Tucker Carlson said, \"it was like Christmas and New Year\\'s and the Super Bowl all put together.\" Carlson seemed reluctant to cover Wednesday\\'s news, calling the hearings \"stupid\" and the importance of the impeachment inquiry \"questionable.\" Grisham called it a \"joke\" while others made jokes — Christian Whiton said witnesses Bill Taylor and George Kent, both veteran public servants with impressive resumes, \"looked like people who sat by themselves at recess.\" It didn\\'t end there. The witnesses were insulted all evening long. And Grisham said foreign service officials who are resisting Trump\\'s policies should resign. Later in the hour, Carlson mocked news outlets for taking this once-in-a-generation impeachment inquiry seriously. \"The media went completely bonkers today,\" he said, while the on-screen graphic alleged a \"MEDIA MELTDOWN.\" He agreed with his guest Larry O\\'Connor, who said America doesn\\'t have a free press because the press is made up of \"political activists.\" Both speakers, by the way, are political activists, and the press IS free. A few minutes later, Trish Regan on the Fox Business Network ran a similar media-bashing segment. At one point her banner just said \"RPT: LIBERAL MEDIA ANTI-TRUMP BIAS,\" which is just a string of triggering words selected to keep Regan\\'s viewers angry and attentive. But I digress. Back to Fox News. Carlson wrapped his hour by calling the city where he lives, Washington, D.C., \"a city in the grip of insanity.\" Then he handed off to Sean Hannity. Hannity: Shut this down. Hannity dubbed day one \"THE WORST SHOW ON EARTH.\" He said the Democrats are \"a national disgrace.\" He said they are guilty of \"an abuse of their power.\" (This is a classic case of \"I know you are but what am I,\" flipping the charge against Trump back on his accusers.) The Democrats are \"corrupt idiots\" who look \"dumb, bad, stupid, and shallow\" after Wednesday\\'s \"sham hearing,\" he said. House Intelligence Committee chair Adam Schiff? A \"congenital liar.\" Wednesday\\'s witnesses? Just \"self-important, uncompelling\" bureaucrats. The hearing was so bad, Hannity said, that \"I\\'m not so sure\" that all the House Democrats will vote for impeachment. \"It was that bad a day for them.\" But even though the day was \"a disaster for Democrats,\" and \"the Republicans had a great day all the way around,\" Hannity said \"this circus, this sham, this charade\" should be \"shut down immediately\" for \"the sake of the country.\" As for Hannity\\'s guests, well, Mark Levin called Schiff \"an incompetent left-wing boob\" and likened the witnesses to \"two homeless guys.\" Donald Trump Jr. said \"everything was hearsay\" from \"career government bureaucrats.\" Steve Scalise said \"a lot\" of Democrats are worried about impeachment backfiring. Which brings me to the 10 p.m. hour. Ed Henry shares hearsay. Laura Ingraham, like her prime time colleagues, criticized Democrats for promoting \"hearsay\" from witnesses who have never spoken directly with the president. Ingraham also welcomed Fox\\'s chief national correspondent Ed Henry, who said he had been working the phones on Capitol Hill. Henry said he spoke to \"three senior Republicans\" who told him that THEY were talking to Democrats who were \"absolutely deflated\" by Wednesday\\'s hearing. So. in other words. hearsay. Then, as if to back up the \"deflated\" claim, Henry quoted what a Dem aide told the Washington Post: \"The onus is on us to wow some people this week.\" But that quote came out before Wednesday\\'s hearing, so it did not prove his point. Ingraham\\'s angle. These banners summed up Fox\\'s 10 p.m. hour: \"DEMOCRATS\\' STAR WITNESSES BURN OUT\" and \"DEMS\\' IMPEACHMENT COLLAPSE.\" Ingraham asserted that impeachment is a \"cataclysmic mistake\" for the other party, after just one day of televised testimony. One of her guests, Republican congressman Chris Stewart, said \"it was really just a huge dud\" and \"there just wasn\\'t any surprises or any bombshells,\" even though there was, in fact, a big surprise: Taylor\\'s disclosure about a July 26 phone call with Gordon Sondland. Later in the day, Trump claimed \"I\\'ve never heard\" of that call. Pretty soon we\\'ll know whether or not that was a lie. But that new disclosure barely came up during Fox\\'s prime time shows. Another GOP lawmaker, Mark Meadows, told Ingraham that Wednesday was \"a swing and a miss for the Democrats.\" And he accused the witnesses of having a \"Ukraine first,\" not \"America first,\" sentiment. At one point in the hour, when Fox\\'s banner said the \"IMPEACHMENT STUNT WILL HAUNT 2020 DEMS,\" I looked up at MSNBC and saw a banner that said \"REPUBLICANS SCRAMBLE TO DEFEND TRUMP AS NEW EVIDENCE TIES TRUMP MORE DIRECTLY TO UKRAINE PUSH.\" Maybe Republican lawmakers are \"scrambling\" to defend Trump, but right-wing TV and radio hosts aren\\'t scrambling at all. They\\'re sounding very confident. Now, maybe that\\'s just part of the performance, part of the act. But Fox\\'s stars on Wednesday night were much more effective than some of the GOP questioners at the hearing. They\\'re not talking about the evidence of extortion, they\\'re talking about bitter Dems and brave Republicans and ensuring the audience that the process will hurt the Dems in 2020. Notes and quotes. Try to square Fox\\'s prime time talking points with \"Fox News Sunday\" moderator Chris Wallace\\'s midday assessment: \"I think that William Taylor was a very impressive witness and was very damaging to the president. \" (The Hill). This Lou Dobbs segment is sparking outrage on social media: \"The husband-and-wife Trump defense team of Joe diGenova and Victoria Toensing\" pushed \"an outlandish conspiracy theory about Ukraine, baselessly alleging that left-wing billionaire George Soros \\'controls a large part of the foreign service part of the State Department and the activities of FBI agents overseas. \\'\" (Mediaite). , \"The Republican playbook here is a time-honored one: delay, deny, obfuscate, and, if that fails, beg Americans to turn off the TV,\" Susan Glasser writes. (New Yorker). Via Frank Pallotta, here\\'s how the late-night shows covered day one. Birthday boy Jimmy Kimmel said he \"got exactly what I wanted this year\" thanks to the hearings. (CNN). Darcy\\'s bottom line. Oliver Darcy writes: All day long, pro-Trump websites hyped clips of GOP stars like Jim Jordan and Devin Nunes \"eviscerating\" or \"destroying\" their opponents. THOSE were the moments that generated focus, not the instances when Taylor or Kent shed new light on the Ukraine scandal. And after the hearings wrapped, Trump\\'s defenders in media dismissed the hearings as \"boring\" and a bust for the Democrats. If you were watching the hearing through the lens of the right-wing media, you probably didn\\'t see a case against the president being built. You probably walked away thinking the Democrats\\' case collapsed. © 2019 Cable News Network. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Listen to CNN (low-bandwidth usage).

       " '(CNN) - Viewers who signed up to stream Disney+ were greeted with disclaimers about racist and offensive content in some older movies. \"Dumbo,\" for example, had this statement at the bottom of the movie\\'s description: \"This program is presented as originally created. It may contain outdated cultural depictions.\" The original \"Dumbo\" notoriously featured a character named Jim Crow, leader of a group of black crows, that was voiced by a Caucasian actor using a stereotypical African-American accent.

       " '(CNN) - Debate over how best to rebuild Notre Dame has rumbled on since the landmark cathedral suffered a devastating fire in April. Now things have got heated between Jean-Louis Georgelin, the French President\\'s special representative for the reconstruction of the cathedral, and chief architect Philippe Villeneuve. \"I have asked to him (Villeneuve) a few times. to shut his mouth so that we can move forward wisely to serenely make the best choices for Notre Dame,\" Georgelin said during a meeting Wednesday. Villeneuve has previously said the Notre Dame spire should be rebuilt as it was before the devastating fire, a view with which Georgelin plainly doesn\\'t agree. In April, French Prime Minister Édouard Philippe announced an international architects\\' competition to rebuild the fallen spire of the cathedral. Debate has centered on whether to rebuild the spire identically or to redesign it. Philippe himself has expressed interest in a more modern redesign, while Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo said she favors an identical restoration. There are also differing opinions over the timeframe of the restoration project. With the Summer Olympics due to be held in Paris in 2024, French President Emmanuel Macron plans to have the structure rebuilt in five years. In April Macron said that when it is rebuilt, it should be \"even more beautiful.\" But some have criticized the shorttime line as a political ploy.

       " '(CNN) - Alicia Keys is hosting the Grammy Awards again next year. Her 2020 return for the 62nd Annual Grammys puts her in rare company after she became the first female to host the Awards in 14 years. Before that, the last woman was Queen Latifah in 2005. \"At first, I did think last year was a one-time thing, but when the opportunity came back around, there was no question about returning as host,\" Keys told Billboard in a statement. \"Last year was such a powerful experience for me. Not only did I feel the love in the room, but I felt it from around the world and it confirmed the healing and unifying power of music.\" Next year\\'s awards will take take place on January 26 at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. This year, she said her status as a regular award receiver helped with her hosting duties. \"I know what it feels like to be on that stage, and I\\'m going to bring that vibe and energy,\" Keys said. On Wednesday Keys had some fun with the announcement, posting a video of herself as the current Alicia Keys discussing hosting with Alicia Keys from February 2019. \"The people wanna know: How ya gonna top this Alicia, c\\'mon!,\" last year\\'s version of Keys says in the video. © 2019 Cable News Network.

       " '(CNN) - The Trump Organization is considering selling its three-year-old hotel in downtown Washington, DC, that\\'s been a focus of ongoing complaints that Donald Trump is profiting off his role as President. Eric Trump, the President\\'s son and executive vice president of The Trump Organization, said the company has hired real estate firm JLL to assist the possible sale of the Trump International Hotel. \"Since we opened our doors, we have received tremendous interest in this hotel and as real estate developers, we are always willing to explore our options,\" Eric Trump said in a statement. No asking price was floated, but it is likely to be expensive. The hotel is in the Old Post Office building, a federally owned property on Pennsylvania Avenue between the White House and Capitol building, and has been a source of controversy since Trump took office in 2017. The President has reported earning $80 million in revenue from the hotel while in office, according to his personal financial reports. Several lawsuits have been filed accusing Trump of violating the Constitution\\'s emolument clause. Although Trump resigned from his companies before taking office, he transferred his assets into a trust. This arrangement allows him to benefit financially from those businesses, including the DC hotel. \"People are objecting to us making so much money on the hotel and therefore we may be willing to sell,\" Eric Trump said. His statement did not list profit figures. A federal court recently revived a lawsuit from the District of Columbia and Maryland, who say the Trump property has harmed Washington hotels and other businesses the states partially own. The House Transportation Committee this week issued a subpoena for documents on the lease from General Services Administration. \"The American people have a right to know whether the President of the United States, who is serving as both the landlord and tenant of the Old Post Office Building, is violating the Emoluments Clauses of the US Constitution to enrich himself,\" said Committee Chairman Peter DeFazio, D-Oregon. After news broke that the hotel might be for sale soon, DeFazio responded in a statement: \"Removing the Trump Organization from the lease of a taxpayer-owned building is a good place to start to ensure President Trump isn\\'t making a profit as both landlord and tenant of the Old Post Office Building, but. I\\'m skeptical that this latest development isn\\'t an attempt to make a massive profit that directly benefits the Trump family so I will be following this marketing attempt closely.\" The GSA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Wall Street Journal first reported the possible sale. Earlier this year, the inspector general of the General Services Administration said the agency \"ignored the Constitution\" when deciding to maintain the lease of the building to the hotel after he was elected to the White House. The Trump Organization won the contract in 2012 and the hotel opened in 2016. © 2019 Cable News Network. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Listen to CNN (low-bandwidth usage).

       " 'Hong Kong (CNN) - Hong Kong looked set for another long day of violent clashes and travel chaos Thursday with protesters occupying several universities across the city amid growing concern over what might happen next. The level of unrest and destruction in the almost six-month-long protest movement has reached new and unnerving heights in recent days, with several people critically injured and Chinese state media warning radical protesters, \"You are on the edge of doom.\" As the sun rose Thursday morning, tear gas was fired near the Hong Kong Polytechnic University in Kowloon as police confronted protesters who have taken over a footbridge and thrown debris onto a major highway. On Hong Kong Island, roads surrounding the University of Hong Kong were also blocked in the morning after protesters built barricades Wednesday night. Universities have emerged as a new focal point of the protest movement, with numerous campuses across the city. At the prestigious Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) in the New Territories, several thousand protesters have effectively barricaded themselves inside the grounds, blocking all entrances for the third straight day on Thursday. The CUHK campus was on Tuesday the scene of some of the most intense fighting in the city since demonstrations began in June over a now-withdrawn China extradition bill that have since expanded into a larger anti-government, pro-democracy movement. Police fired more than 1,567 canisters of tear gas during an attempted clearance operation at the university. Throughout the day Wednesday, protesters and those helping them poured into the sprawling grounds, bringing supplies, including protective gear, food and water. A highly organized operation was launched inside the campus, sorting and distributing the supplies, building and reinforcing barricades, and stockpiling weapons, including petrol bombs, bows and arrows, javelins, and pieces of wood hammered with nails. Many overseas students studying at the university have been asked to leave by their home colleges and CUHK administrators announced the early cancellation of classes, stopping the fall semester around two weeks early. On Wednesday, police said they had evacuated several students from mainland China via police boat, because the roads were blocked by protesters. The effects of the campus unrest could be felt across the city Thursday, with continued travel disruptions and large numbers of protesters taking over the busy streets in Central district for a fourth straight day. Office workers also came out in support of the protesters in Tai Koo, in the east of the city. Two of the three tunnels connecting Hong Kong Island with the Kowloon peninsula, including the busiest Cross-Harbour Tunnel, were closed to traffic Thursday morning and the MTR continued to suspend service at several stations. All schools have suspended classes for the rest of the week, the first such instance since protests began. The protests this week have taken a dark turn, with more people critically injured than at any point in the long-running movement. Hong Kong\\'s Hospital Authority said 67 people were treated in hospitals in total on Wednesday with injuries related to the protests. On Wednesday, a 70-year-old man was hospitalized and remains in critical condition after being hit on the head by a brick thrown by a protester, police said. The injured man was on a lunch break from his job as a cleaner when he voluntarily began clearing bricks from the road with other members of the public, according to police. Video of the alleged incident shows protesters and government supporters hurling bricks at one another before a man falls to the ground. A 15-year-old boy was struck in the head by what is believed to be a tear gas canister and is also in critical condition, according to Hong Kong\\'s Hospital Authority. Earlier in the week, a protester was shot by police and a man was set on fire following a dispute with protesters Monday. \\'You are on the edge of doom\\'. The major escalation in political unrest this week has once again raised questions over what will happen next. Looming over those conversations is the specter of a possible Chinese intervention. On Thursday, China\\'s top state-run television channel issued an online editorial telling protesters their actions are \"undisguised terrorism.\" \"We have had enough talking, persuasion and warnings. To stop the unrest has to be implemented and advanced more resolutely now. The country will never accept the situation to be out of control, justice to be covered or Hong Kong to be sunk,\" the editorial from CCTV read. It echoed an editorial in the state-run tabloid Global Times suggesting the People\\'s Armed Police and the People\\'s Liberation Army were ready to back up Hong Kong\\'s government \"when necessary.\" \"We also warn the radical protesters: You are on the edge of doom. Those who are coerced to be \\'valiant\\' should walk away as soon as possible when you still can make the call,\" the editorial said. However, it is not clear if Beijing has a red line, and what it would take for protesters to cross it before provoking a Chinese military response. Analysts say it is still a question that Beijing is actively considering. \"It\\'s smart not to state a clear red line because you are going to have to act on it to keep your credibility once that line has been breached. And there is every likelihood that protesters would actively seek to breach that line,\" Adam Ni, a China researcher at Macquarie University in Sydney told CNN last month. The Chinese government has hinted that it might be looking at new ways of resolving the crisis in Hong Kong, both short-term and long-term. After a meeting of a top Chinese Communist Party body in October, senior Chinese official Shen Chunyao said that Beijing would work to improve the legal system and strengthen \"law enforcement\" in Hong Kong, and neighboring Macao. He added it was time to introduce new lessons in \"patriotism\" across Hong Kong, a move which has been discussed by the Chinese government for a long time. On Tuesday, the Chinese government unveiled a new range of patriotic education measures for the country, which according to state-run Xinhua would \"focus on young Chinese.\" \"Patriotism should be embedded in the whole process of school education,\" the article said. Buried in point 20 of the new patriotic education outline is a call to \"guide\" the citizens of Hong Kong and Macao to \"enhance their national identity and consciously safeguard national unity.\" © 2019 Cable News Network.

Garth Brooks took home the prestigious Entertainer of the Year award that more than a few wanted to see go to Carrie Underwood. Underwood, who co-hosted with fellow superstars Dolly Parton and Reba McEntire, has had a banner year with her \"Cry Pretty\" album and tour. But Brooks bested her, as well as Eric Church, Chris Stapleton and Keith Urban, to take home the trophy, prompting one person to tweet \"This is such a slap in the face.\" \"Not only to Carrie, but to the women of country music in general,\" the tweet went on to say. \"So much for celebrating women tonight, but you\\'re going to continue giving these awards to mediocre men. @CountryMusic congrats on getting it wrong yet again.\" Underwood, who has cohosted since 2008, had even garnered some high-profile support prior to the show. Last month, Miranda Lambert posted a lengthy explanation on Instagram about why Underwood deserved the award. The post highlighted Underwood\\'s all-female tour and \"That iconic voice has been classin\\' up our stages, charts and televisions for a decade and a half.\" \"She blows me away every time I hear her sing,\" Lambert wrote. \"She never wavers in who she is or what she stands for.

       " 'Washington (CNN) - The first public impeachment hearing on Wednesday lived up to the hype, and the daylong affair gave both parties plenty to chew on as the inquiry moves forward. The senior US diplomat in Ukraine, Bill Taylor, and a senior State Department official overseeing Ukraine policy, George Kent, testified before the House Intelligence Committee for hours in front of cameras. They repeated many of the same points they had made during private depositions last month. The hearing was the first public display of allegations against President Donald Trump that he abused his powers to seek political favors from the Ukrainian government. Democrats extracted helpful answers from Taylor and Kent that they\\'ll surely use if they start drafting articles of impeachment against the President. Republicans also landed some punches, needling both witnesses over their lack of direct contact with Trump. But other players scheduled to tell their stories on Capitol Hill had direct contact with Trump, raising the stakes for their testimony. Here\\'s what we learned Wednesday, and what it means for the next steps, as additional witnesses are slated for private interviews and public hearings in the coming days. New evidence against Trump. Taylor told lawmakers about another conversation when Trump again voiced his desire to push the Ukrainians to publicly announce investigations, which would give his 2020 campaign a boost. This conversation gets at a key question of the inquiry: What was Trump telling top US diplomats working on Ukraine policy? He was told that Ukrainians were ready to \"move forward\" on those investigations, during a phone call with US Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, which Taylor\\'s aide overheard at a restaurant in Kiev and relayed to his boss. That conversation was on July 26, one day after Trump\\'s call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, where he pressed Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden. Taylor said his aide also asked Sondland what Trump thought of Ukraine. Sondland replied that Trump \"cares more about the investigations of Biden, which Giuliani was pressing for.\" David Holmes, Taylor\\'s aide who overheard Trump asking about the investigations and asked Sondland about Trump\\'s views on Ukraine, will provide closed-door testimony as part of the House impeachment inquiry on Friday. Trump\\'s talking points are being contradicted. Trump\\'s favorite talking points on Ukraine are being disputed. This was clear from earlier deposition transcripts, it happened on Wednesday and will likely continue in future hearings. Kent testified that Trump was \"trying to dig up dirt\" on a political rival, rebutting Trump\\'s claim that he was fighting corruption in Ukraine. Taylor said there was \"no good policy reason\" and \"no good national security reason\" for Trump to withhold US military assistance from Ukraine, even though the White House argued there were legitimate reasons to do so over the summer. Both men also said they are not \"never Trumpers.\" Trump has levied these accusations against Taylor, and tweeted \"NEVER TRUMPERS!\" hours before the hearing began on Wednesday. The GOP is leaning into conspiracy theories. Rep. Devin Nunes of California, the top Republican on the committee, did what he has done for years and leaned heavily into debunked conspiracy theories during his opening statement. He referenced the Trump-Russia dossier and the opposition research firm Fusion GPS. He repeatedly stated that Democratic operatives had colluded with Ukraine to meddle in the 2016 election and defeat Trump, though several key witnesses have already testified that this is not true. The fact-free approach puzzled the witnesses, and didn\\'t seem effective, though it could gain traction in right-wing outlets that are friendly to the President. Other GOP lawmakers used their time to poke holes in the allegations against Trump and to point out that neither of the witnesses had any firsthand conversations with the President. That looked like a wiser strategy. Split verdict on staff lawyers\\' questioning. High-profile congressional hearings have been something of a subplot to Trump\\'s presidency: former FBI Director James Comey, Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, special counsel Robert Mueller. Most have been marked by theatrics from lawmakers eager to make a splash during their questioning, rather than suss out information from their witnesses. Wednesday, at least initially, was different. Democratic and Republican staff lawyers led the questioning, which tamped down the circus-like atmosphere. Daniel Goldman, the Democratic attorney, sought to build out a narrative from the witnesses about the delay in aid to Ukraine. Republican Steve Castor\\'s questioning was bumpier, drawing sometimes bewildered looks from the witnesses. Eventually, lawmakers took over — and the dramatics began, particularly from Republicans, who used their time to make extended statements about the whistleblower. By most accounts, the Republican lawmakers fared better than Castor in driving home their points. The question going forward is whether the GOP side will stick to the lawyer strategy or adopt a different approach. Mulvaney still at the center of the storm. Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney\\'s name arose at several points in Wednesday\\'s hearing. He was identified by the witnesses as a central player in the decision to withhold US assistance to Ukraine. And the October news conference in which he acknowledged a quid pro quo was mentioned as well. (Mulvaney later denied he had said that). It\\'s an indication Democrats are intent on further probing Mulvaney\\'s role in the alleged scheme to pressure Ukraine into investigating Trump\\'s political rivals. Mulvaney has defied a subpoena to appear before the committees, and created internal White House angst at his legal maneuverings to avoid testifying. As Republicans argue that witnesses like Kent and Taylor are relaying second- and third-hand information, the urgency only increases to hear from witnesses, like Mulvaney, who can get them closer to Trump. Mulvaney told reporters last month to \"get over it,\" referring to the alleged quid pro quo, and said \"there\\'s going to be political influence in foreign policy.\" But Taylor told lawmakers that in his 50 years of public service, he had never seen another example of foreign aid being conditioned on the personal or political interests of a president. The stakes are rising for Sondland. Sondland\\'s direct conversations with Trump will face new scrutiny after Wednesday\\'s testimony. Taylor said that his aide had overheard that direct conversation between Sondland and Trump in which the President asked for an update on the Ukrainians announcing investigations. GOP lawmakers repeatedly described Taylor\\'s testimony as a secondhand retelling of things that he had heard from others, some suggested it wouldn\\'t be admissible evidence at a criminal trial. Sondland is known for having a direct line to Trump. During his closed-door testimony he told lawmakers about a conversation with Trump on July 26 when he was in Kiev. He called it \"short\" and \"nonsubstantive.\" He also claimed the conversation did not have anything to do with the Trump-Zelensky phone call the day before. But there are overlapping elements of the discussions. On the July 25 call, Trump also mentioned the investigations he wanted the Ukrainians to pursue. Sondland will also be asked about his determination that Trump \"cares more\" about investigations of Biden than Ukraine policy. Taylor revealed that Sondland had spoken with Trump at least once on his cell phone in a public setting, where they could be overheard by anyone, which may also prompt further questions about Sondland\\'s tradecraft and digital security. The Democrats\\' case is still complicated. After the Russia investigation wrapped up in March, key Democrats observed that Mueller\\'s findings and 448-page report were probably too complicated to sell to the American people. There was no groundswell for impeachment among public opinion or in the Democratic ranks. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and others felt that the Ukraine issue was different, a clear and simple abuse of power, and Democrats launched the impeachment inquiry in September. But the case has become complicated, with thousands of pages of depositions piling up, and public hearings dragging on for hours. Most Americans don\\'t know the Ukrainians involved. Nothing is simple, and Democrats might struggle to make this digestible again. © 2019 Cable News Network. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Listen to CNN (low-bandwidth usage).

He passed away at 10:51 p.m. local time (9:51 a.m. ET) at the Prince of Wales Hospital in the New Territories. The case will be referred to the coroner. The elderly man\\'s death is the second in nearly six months of confrontations between Hong Kong authorities and protesters demanding democracy in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory. A 22-year-old Hong Kong university student who suffered a severe head injury after falling in a parking garage near the scene of protests died last Friday. The student Chow Tsz-lok\\'s death was the first in Hong Kong\\'s anti-government unrest and inflamed tensions in the city. In the days since, the level of destruction in Hong Kong has reached new and unnerving heights.

       " '(CNN) - Conversations with kids force us to think hard about the power of words. While adults tend to view language as fluid and open to interpretation, kids tend to be fairly rigid about it. They want clear explanations about what a word means. They also want to know where the thing or concept that is represented by the word, fits in their fairly simplistic, proto-Kantian, this-is-good-this-is-bad moral universe. If parents want to express nuance, they have to be extremely careful with word choice, and even more careful with how they define it. The words I\\'ve been struggling with recently are \"screen time.\" When my eldest son was younger, and screen time meant either watching \"Caillou\" or dragging a 2-D train around the surface of an iPad, I didn\\'t think much of it. Both were fairly straightforward and benign activities. But now that he\\'s 7, and \"screen time\" can be used for an ever-expanding range of activities, I\\'ve begun to doubt its utility. Can everything from logic video games, to high adrenaline racing games, to Facetime with grandma, to wildlife documentaries, to looking at family photos, to ninja cartoons really all belong in one category. Perhaps if \"screen time\" were a neutral term, this wouldn\\'t matter. But the phrase is loaded with negative connotations, and is associated with guilt and addiction. My 7-year-old son has already internalized this screen-time-equals-bad-time equation and has begun to turn it back on me. I was recently cooking dinner and consulting a recipe on my phone when he, unsatisfied with my ability to play with him in the moment, told me I was addicted to my phone. \"I just don\\'t want to burn the potatoes!\" I explained, in self-defense. I could have shown him my below average screen time metrics, but I doubt it would have helped. \"Screen time,\" I think I am done with you. You\\'re outdated and clumsy and I don\\'t like the way you conflate and taint every single activity done on a digital device, no matter it\\'s value. I also don\\'t appreciate the way people present you in opposition to real life when the reality is so much more complicated. With you gone, I\\'ll actually be able to have the kind of conversations I should be having with my children about digital life. I\\'ll be able to talk about the value of one digital activity at a time, exploring both the pleasures and pitfalls of plugging in. Screen time is an outdated term. For most of its history, \"screen time\" referred to how much time an actor got on screen. It wasn\\'t until the 1990s when it began to be applied to how much time we spent looking at screens. As we\\'ve begun to spend more time interacting digitally, the use of the phrase, and the concern over what it represents, has grown. But today, with screens being ubiquitous and quotidian, the catchall phrase no longer works. Screens are where we keep our cookbooks, CD collections, research libraries, banks, newspapers, teacher-parent and teacher-student communications and the list goes on and on. Our digital lives are \"way more complex than we ever imagined they would be, even 10 years ago. The language we use just isn\\'t useful anymore. It\\'s not granular enough, and doesn\\'t capture the nuances of life,\" said Janis Whitlock, a research scientist at Cornell University and co-author of a recent editorial on the limits of the screen time concept for JAMA Pediatrics. \"It\\'s still default for many of us to see a screen and say \\'that is not life well-lived.\\' But my lived experience as a person and an academic tells me it is just not true,\" she added, noting that both she and her teenage children do a fair amount of meaningful socializing and academic work on screens. In her editorial, Whitlock, along with her co-author Philipp K. Masur, considered the latest research on screen time and well-being and academic performance and found the results to be mixed and ultimately inconclusive. More so, the metric of time revealed itself to be only a small piece of the puzzle in figuring out how being online affects us. There are so many variables in the way screens are used: What kind of device are we on? Are we being active or passive? What kind of content are we engaging with? These all play a role in determining the potential benefits or harms of being plugged-in. Yet, our language and framing remains preoccupied exclusively with how long we\\'re spending. More is always bad, and less is always good. \"I don\\'t like the stigma attached to \\'screen time,\\' or the way it is coded. It makes us talk about the things our kids love as if they are drugs. They are not drugs, even if they sometimes have some things wrong with them,\" said Jordan Shapiro, author of \"The New Childhood: Raising Kids to Thrive in a Connected World.\" Shapiro thinks we\\'ve scapegoated the screen as the problem, when it\\'s not. The problem is the way we use screens, and it\\'s something parents should be helping their kids with from a young age. What to say instead. Whitlock said giving up the phrase \"screen time\" shouldn\\'t mean that parents stop thinking about the broader effects, good and bad, digital engagement has on our lives. Our lives are fundamentally different than they were a generation ago, with massive shifts to our sense of time and space. Being home no longer means what it used to now that the world is at our fingertips. This isn\\'t always a good thing. Also, while the screens themselves may not be a problem, many of the products for screens, like YouTube and Instagram, are designed to be attention-grabbing. For many, especially teenagers, self-regulation in the face of these products can be hard. Whitlock suggests parents help their children regulate by way of conversations with their kids about the addictive properties of these products, and also intervene by way of installing blackout times on routers and cellular connection. She also suggests parents voyage with their children to some darker corners of the internet, before they get there with their friends. This might include, for instance, some fairly uncomfortable, but highly educational, shared internet porn viewing when kids are in their tween years. \"Tell them: This is what you are going to see and this is what you should know about it,\" she said. As for how to talk about the very wide range of not-obviously-bad, but perhaps not-obviously-good activities kids might get into through digital devices, it\\'s much more complicated. Instead of considering whether they were on screens, and how much time they spent there, Shapiro thinks we should be probing the nature of the activity itself. \"Ask yourself if they are using screens in a way that allows them to develop autonomy, and a moral and ethical consciousness,\" he said. As a first step, I decided to replace \"screen time,\" with the names of specific digital activities my son likes: racing video games, television, Facetime, coding games, etc. They will all be considered on their own terms, with their own good and bad qualities taken into consideration. Also, some will broader categories, like YouTube, will require subcategories. If my son is messing around on his own on the site, watching unboxing videos and toy demonstrations, then that\\'s not terribly productive. But if we are co-viewing videos about a particular subject that could make for a rich shared experience. Lately he\\'s taken an interest in cars and we spend 15 minutes every evening watching videos about cars together, learning about new technologies and the physics of automobile races. Through it, he\\'s also getting a taste of the world of status symbols, which, as Shapiro reminded me, is on us to deconstruct for him. Our newfound, more nuanced approach to his time online doesn\\'t mean his dad and I will go soft in other areas. We\\'ll still make sure he gets enough exercise, reads books, and spends time outdoors. We just won\\'t pit those activities against the time spent on devices, or arrange them in a tidy hierarchy in which all things digital are immediately thrust to the bottom. If it all goes well, my son will soon forget the concept of \"screen time\" and come to understand the complexity of digital life. There will be no more badgering one another for consulting a recipe, and more thought-provoking conversation about what we are doing on our devices, and how it makes us think and feel. © 2019 Cable News Network.

       " '(CNN) - Veneto regional council, which is located on Venice\\'s Grand Canal, was flooded for the first time in its history on Tuesday night, just after it rejected measures to combat climate change. The historic Italian city has been brought to its knees this week by the worst flooding there in more than 50 years. And the council chamber in Ferro Fini Palace started to take in water around 10 p.m. local time, as councilors were debating the 2020 regional budget, Democratic Party councilor Andrea Zanoni said in a long Facebook post. \"Ironically, the chamber was flooded two minutes after the majority League, Brothers of Italy, and Forza Italia parties rejected our amendments to tackle climate change,\" Zanoni, who is deputy chairman of the environment committee, said in the post, which also has photographs of the room under water. Among the rejected amendments were measures to fund renewable sources, to replace diesel buses with \"more efficient and less polluting ones,\" to scrap polluting stoves and reduce the impact of plastics, he said. Zanoni went on to accuse Veneto regional president Luca Zaia, who is a member of Matteo Salvini\\'s far-right League Party, of presenting a budget \"with no concrete actions to combat climate change.\" The regional council\\'s spokesman Alessandro Ovizach confirmed to CNN that the council was flooded after discussing amendments to the 2020 budget, without specifying which ones. The council\\'s president, the League\\'s Roberto Ciambetti, rejected Zanoni\\'s accusations in a statement to CNN. \"Beyond propaganda and deceptive reading, we are voting (for) a regional budget that spent €965 million over the past three years in the fight against air pollution, smog, which is a determining factor in climate change,\" said the statement. \"To say that we do nothing is a lie,\" Ciambetti said. \"We are a region that after the 2010 flood launched a plan to safeguard hydrogeological safety for a total cost of €2.6 billion, an exorbitant amount for regional finances.\" Ciambetti also mentioned the €468 million spent in the aftermath of the Vaia storm last year which flattened hundreds of thousands of trees. Earlier Ciambetti, who posted videos of the flooding at Ferro Fini Palace on his Facebook page, said in a statement to local paper Giornale di Vicenza:. \"Never had such a situation occurred here (at the Council). The flood-proof bulkheads were not sufficient to contain the flood wave, nor was it possible to leave the building. It was preferred to guarantee safety and therefore to stay all inside the palace.\" The regional council meetings on Thursday and Friday were moved to Treviso because of the flooding, according to the council\\'s website. On Tuesday, Venice\\'s mayor Luigi Brugnaro blamed climate change for the unusually high tides in Venice, and said the flooding was \"a wound that will leave a permanent mark.\" CNN has reached out to Zanoni for comment. © 2019 Cable News Network.

Last year, he fell short in his race against Hyde-Smith, losing by 8 percentage points despite her having a string of controversies, many of them touching on issues of race. \"It\\'s official. I\\'m running to be Mississippi\\'s next U.S. Too many people here can\\'t find a decent job, rural hospitals are closing, and the price for education is just too high,\" Espy said in a tweet on Tuesday. He added in a statement on his Senate campaign website that \"Cindy Hyde-Smith promotes images that do not represent today\\'s Mississippi.\" \"She openly laughs about public hangings and makes statements supporting voter suppression,\" Espy said, referencing two videos posted in 2018 in which Hyde-Smith appeared to say laws that make it \"just a little more difficult\" for attendees of some of the state\\'s universities to vote are a \"great idea\" and joked that she\\'d be in \"the front row\" if one of her supporters invited her to a \"public hanging.\" \"It\\'s hard to bring good jobs to Mississippi with a United States Senator acting like that,\" Espy said in the statement on his campaign site. In a response at the time, Hyde-Smith called criticism about her \"public hanging\" remarks \"twisted,\" saying that \"it was turned into a weapon\" to be used against her. She said the other video was \"selectively edited\" and that she had been \"making a joke.\" The 2018 runoff was triggered when no candidate received 50% of the vote. Hyde-Smith had been appointed that April to fill the Senate seat vacated by Republican Sen. Thad Cochran, who had stepped down due to health reasons. President Donald Trump, who won Mississippi by 18 percentage points in 2016, campaigned for Hyde-Smith the day before the runoff. Ultimately, there wasn\\'t much movement off the 2016 baseline. No Democrat has come closer than 8 points to a Republican in the last 30 years, and only two Democrats have come within single digits. Espy served as the agriculture secretary under President Bill Clinton until he resigned in 1994 after the start of a probe into allegations he had improperly accepted gifts and favors while heading the department. He was later acquitted of related charges. © 2019 Cable News Network. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Listen to CNN (low-bandwidth usage). Go to the full CNN experience.',\n",

       " '(CNN) - The manhunt for a Marine deserter wanted for murder led Roanoke, Virginia, police to shut down all schools in the city Thursday. Authorities received a call about 4 a.m. regarding a sighting of Michael Alexander Brown, 22, who is suspected of killing his mother\\'s boyfriend last week in Hardy, about 9 miles east of Roanoke. The motive in the killing is unclear. Brown deserted his post at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina last month, police said. Though Franklin County authorities said this week he was driving a 2008 Lincoln Town Car, Roanoke Police Chief Tim Jones said Brown was driving an RV when he was spotted in Roanoke. A resident called police to say that a man in a black jacket was tapping on a window, and police responded and were \"able to confirm to the best of our ability that it was Mr. Brown,\" Jones said,. The RV, which was located nearby, was secured by a tactical team. Brown was believed to be on foot, perhaps looking for another vehicle, Jones said. Brown is considered dangerous and may be armed with a \"shoulder-held, high-capacity weapon,\" Jones said. He has family ties in the Roanoke area, the chief said. The Franklin County Sheriff\\'s Office warned the public Monday that Brown was armed with a high-powered firearm and possibly other weapons. Anyone who sees him should use caution and call police. Brown stands about 6 feet tall, weighs 154 pounds and has brown hair and blue eyes, police said. Brown was last seen wearing a black jacket, Jones said. \"He is navigationally savvy,\" Jones said. \"He knows how to move around. He\\'s not afraid to change his location. He\\'s not afraid to change his look.\" In addition to asking students, faculty and staff not to report to school Thursday, police also want anyone who lives within a half mile of Patrick Henry High School on Grandin Road to shelter in place and keep their doors locked. About 2,000 students attend the high school. The US Marshals Service is offering a $10,000 reward for information leading to Brown\\'s apprehension, Jones said. North Carolina authorities have charged Brown with second-degree murder and using a firearm in the commission of a felony. © 2019 Cable News Network. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.

       " 'Editor\\'s Note: This story originally ran May 3, 2019. It has been updated to note that an appeals court dismissed a challenge from Maryland and the District of Columbia, which claimed President Donald Trump had violated the Emoluments Clause through his continued ownership of the Trump International Hotel in Washington. (CNN) - When Benjamin Franklin, the first US ambassador to France, was given a diamond-encrusted snuff box by the King, he followed the rules against \"emoluments\" to officials by foreign states and asked Congress if he could keep it. They said sure, and he did. When President Barack Obama won the Nobel Peace Prize and got $1.4 million, he gave the money to charity. Those were official gifts given to officials. Less clear is whether the Trump Organization should have to ask Congress every time a foreign government wants to spend money at President Donald Trump\\'s hotels. But it\\'s an important question, and it\\'s being litigated for the first time in US history during the Trump administration, since foreign governments seem to be spending a lot of money at Trump\\'s hotels. An appeals court in Virginia has rejected an emoluments lawsuit filed by Maryland and the District of Columbia, whose attorneys general said they would continue to pursue their legal claims against Trump over his ownership of the Trump International Hotel near the White House. It\\'s just about impossible to separate Donald Trump the man from Trump the business, which was always the point. Trump is the brand. That was going to create some conflicts of interest when he became the President. The man whose sole job had been enriching himself and his business now had the power of the US government behind him and the responsibility of representing the American people abroad. It\\'s a unique situation in US history, where the President is actively benefiting from his name while in office. And it turns out the Constitution guards against exactly this sort of thing. An emolument is a payment or favor. \"Emoluments\" are mentioned three times in the nation\\'s founding document, an archaic term that, according to Merriam-Webster, is \"the returns arising from office or employment usually in the form of compensation or perquisites.\" The most important mention of emoluments in the Constitution is extremely clear in Article 1, Section 9:. \"No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.\" That makes total sense; as President, Trump is supposed to be representing the people, not himself, when he meets with foreign leaders. And it should be very easy for Trump the man to not take any emoluments from foreign states. The man and the business share the same name, however, and it\\'s plastered on many buildings across the world, including one that houses a federally owned building Trump leases for his hotel a few blocks from the White House, where Trump carries out the nation\\'s business. Payments to Trump\\'s business by foreigners. Since the early days of Trump\\'s administration, foreign states have been paying handsome sums to stay at his Trump International Hotel in Washington. Three separate lawsuits have challenged whether Trump has violated the emoluments clause, both for payments received from governments or trademarks granted by them. One was brought by an ethics group, one by Democrats in Congress and one by the governments of the District of Columbia and Maryland. The lawsuits are all in the court system and there\\'s little doubt one or all will end up before the Supreme Court. One possible example of payments by a foreign government is the $270,000 paid by a lobbying firm tied to Saudi Arabia for 500 nights of rooms at Trump\\'s DC hotel around his inauguration. The firm put up groups of visiting US veterans in the rooms. That Saudi Arabia has business before Trump the President is without question. The kingdom buys copious arms and military equipment from the US. But it also has dealings with Trump the business. A visit early in 2018 by the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia to Manhattan helped stop two years of declining revenue at the Trump International Hotel in New York, according to a letter obtained by The Washington Post. This was before the prince, Mohammed bin Salman, was implicated in the 2018 killing of journalist and dissident Jamal Kashoggi, a point the Saudi government continues to deny. Bin Salman did not stay at Trump\\'s hotel, but it did host members of the Saudi entourage. The Embassy of the Philippines. Trump has a friendly relationship with that country\\'s strongman leader, held an event at Trump hotels and admitted they were hoping it would send a statement of closeness with the President, according to an interview with a Philippines TV station quoted by the Post. Some of the arrangements have undergone some government review, but not, apparently, been OK\\'d by Congress. DOJ says these aren\\'t emoluments. These are business exchanges, according to the Justice Department, arguing on Trump\\'s official behalf, and so are not emoluments. At his confirmation hearing to become attorney general, William Barr said he hadn\\'t yet researched the issue, but he offered a pretty good representation of the government\\'s argument on behalf of Trump. Basically, they say the Constitution\\'s prohibition on presents or emoluments from foreign states shouldn\\'t be applied to the commercial exchange of a good or a service, even if the person benefiting is the President. It\\'s an argument that upends more than 150 years of very strict interpretation of emoluments, according to Washington University law professor Kathleen Clark, who has studied the issue in depth and published a recent paper that said the Department of Justice is acting more like Trump\\'s personal lawyers than the country\\'s. \"The Justice Department has veered away from its long track record of vigilance on behalf of the republic,\" she says in her report. \"Instead, the Department adopted the legal arguments put forward by Donald Trump\\'s personal lawyers, pushing for a narrow interpretation of the clause in order to advance Trump\\'s private financial interests.\" Trump\\'s lawyers have said he cannot be sued in his official capacity. Who runs the Trump Organization. Trump gave up day-to-day operations of his business to his two older sons when he took up the day-to-day business of the people, but he didn\\'t give up his ownership stake in the Trump Organization. If the lawsuits progress, the Trump Organization could be forced to disclose information about its interactions with foreign governments. Trump has guarded his financial privacy by not releasing his tax returns and the company has too. Emoluments and the Constitution. It was concerns about influence generally that led to the inclusion of the emoluments clause in the Constitution in the first place, according to notes taken by James Madison in which he said that Charles Pinckney \"urged the necessity of preserving foreign Ministers & other officers of the U.S. independent of external influence and moved to insert\" the clause. In an odd note of history, it was Pinckney\\'s later umbrage at a French demand for bribes while he served as a US diplomat that led to what history knows as \"the XYZ affair\" and an undeclared \"quasi-war\" between the US and France. Another framer, Edmund Jennings Randolph, said at the Constitutional Convention that the acceptance of emoluments could be an impeachable offense or at least reason to vote against reelecting a President, according to a 2016 Brookings report on the subject. \"If discovered he may be impeached,\" said Randolph. \"If he be not impeachable he may be displaced at the end of the four years. I consider, therefore, that he is restrained from receiving any present or emoluments whatever.\" There was also consideration of an amendment that would strip US citizenship from officeholders who had accepted emoluments from foreign powers. © 2019 Cable News Network.

       " '(CNN) - The South Pole has been home to penguins, whales and, 100 million years ago, dinosaurs with fluffy feathers, new findings show. This is the first time scientists have ever found evidence that dinosaurs used feathers in extreme climates like the southern polar circle, according to the study, which was published this week in the journal Gondwana Research. A team of international scientists examined a collection of 118-year-old fossils that were found in Koonwarra, Australia, but that had accumulated in sediment at the bottom of a lake close to the South Pole millennia ago. The collection included dinosaur bones and \"proto-feathers from meat-eating dinosaurs,\" said a press release from Sweden\\'s Uppsala University, which contributed to the study. The term \"proto-feathers\" means that these ancient feathers weren\\'t as complex as the feathers in birds today. Instead, the press release said, dinosaurs at the time would have been covered with simpler \"hair-like\" feathers for insulation. \"The discovery of \\'proto-feathers\\' at Koonwarra therefore suggests that fluffy feather coats might have helped small dinosaurs keep warm in ancient polar habitats,\" said Martin Kundrat of Slovakia\\'s Pavol Jozef Safarik University, one of the authors. Much like how bird feathers today are often colored or patterned, these ancient dinosaur feathers were also likely patterned, the press release said. Researchers found traces of melanosomes, the cells that contain color pigments, on the fossilized feathers, in \"distinct bands\" that may have represented the original patterning. Researchers believe the feathers were dark in color, perhaps to help the dinosaurs with camouflage, communication with each other, or to absorb more heat in the frigid polar temperatures. Dinosaur skeletons and ancient bird bones have been found at high latitudes before, but this is the first fossilized evidence of feathered dinosaurs. \"These Australian fossil feathers are therefore highly significant because they came from dinosaurs and small birds that were living in a seasonally very cold environment with months of polar darkness every year,\" said study author Benjamin Kear of Uppsala University. Other feathered dinosaurs have previously been found elsewhere, the bird-like dinosaur Archaeopteryx, largely found in Germany, had feathers and wings. In China, too, researchers have found evidence of a \"dragon dinosaur\" with short, resplendently-feathered wings. © 2019 Cable News Network. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

       " 'Editor\\'s Note: Nadine Jolie Courtney is the author of the novel \"All-American Muslim Girl.\" Her writing has appeared in Angeleno, O: The Oprah Magazine, Architectural Digest, Town & Country and elsewhere. The views expressed here are hers. Read more opinion on CNN. (CNN) - On January 27th, 2017, after President Donald Trump issued an executive order banning entry to the US by citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries (and indefinitely halting refugees from Syria), thousands of protesters stormed John F. Kennedy airport in New York City, and other airports around the country, proclaiming their solidarity with Muslims. Countless more, I among them, watched on television as the events unfolded. It was a watershed moment for American Muslims like me, who had grown up believing that people would judge us for our religion. The sky was blue, water was wet, and other Americans looked down on Islam. These were facts we internalized. It\\'s why for most of my life, I\\'ve lived as a white-passing, mixed-raced Muslim: green eyes, blonde hair, fair skin. Despite my father\\'s Middle Eastern and Asian ancestry, I look a lot like my white, Catholic-born mother: the basic girl-next-door. But for me, the day Trump instituted the travel ban and Americans from all walks of life fought back against it was doubly profound: it\\'s the day I stopped hiding. It\\'s the day I re-opened the word document on my computer and started writing the personal story I\\'d been too afraid to explore for 10 years. It\\'s the day I officially began writing my novel \"All-American Muslim Girl\", about Islamophobia, white privilege, identity and erasure. Because of my appearance, the Islamophobia I\\'ve experienced over the years is very different from that of my Muslim cousins, aunts and friends. People don\\'t stare at me at the grocery store or make comments about my appearance or lack of hijab while I\\'m working out. I don\\'t get told in parking lots to \"go back where I came from.\" I\\'ve never had somebody yell \"Allahu akbar!\" at me in the hallway at school. All of these things have happened to people I love. Unlike them, I almost never feel in danger because of my religion. Instead, I\\'m subject to microaggressions: people\\'s jaws dropping when they find out I\\'m Muslim. Incredulous comments like, \"You? But you look so American! \", as if Muslims can\\'t be Americans, too. People staring at me quizzically, asking of my heritage, \"So, like. what are you?\" And, of course, the endless questions about whether I pray, whether I drink, whether I eat bacon, whether I support various international policies, as if they\\'re trying to figure out whether they can trust me. It\\'s not just the comments. When I was in elementary school, in the thick of years spent keeping my family\\'s religion silent — a privilege obviously afforded to us by virtue of pale skin, stemming from my father\\'s Circassian heritage, my best friend\\'s family didn\\'t know we were Muslims. Soon after my friend\\'s mother found out, my friend sheepishly told me I was no longer able to come over to her house. I hadn\\'t done anything wrong: had never been impolite, had never broken anything or raised my voice. My friend shrugged, unable to provide an answer. Her mom just didn\\'t feel comfortable having me over any longer. Years of hiding has produced a tension between the two sides of myself: the side who \"came out\" after the Muslim ban and started enthusiastically, publicly claiming my \"Muslimness\". and the side that had built a life where people were completely unaware of my religion, my heritage, and family, and the fact that, yes, I do actually pray every day. Yes, in Arabic. When those people, the ones who I work with, who I regularly but casually chat with in the world — find out about the title of my book, I typically dread the reaction. It\\'s always the same:. \"But. you\\'re not Muslim, right? Before writing the book, my father\\'s words would always ring in my ears: \"People will treat you differently if they know you\\'re Muslim. \" But I wanted people to know I was a Muslim. I\\'m proud of my heritage, and I feel honored to practice such a beautiful, if wildly misunderstood, religion. My novel debunks myths about Islam by gently educating people — through the eyes of a young white-passing 16-year-old who is exploring her family\\'s religion herself for the first time, but it was important to me not to \"justify\" the religion for Western eyes. Ironically, after I started publicly identifying as Muslim, I was especially nervous about the reaction of the Muslim community. After all, I don\\'t wear a hijab, I\\'ve enjoyed many a bottle of Cabernet in my time, I rarely attend mosque and my mother-in-law is even an Episcopalian nun. (That\\'s a different story for another time.) Forget my appearance: my lifestyle disqualified me from being seen as a good Muslim. But then I realized I was falling into my own trap: the idea that Muslims are a monolith, and the idea that it\\'s okay for anybody to believe that because you\\'re a Muslim, you can only be one way. There is no such thing as One Muslim. We are the world\\'s second-largest religion, and that includes Muslims of every nationality, skin color, ethnicity, lifestyle and background, yes, even basic American girls. The worry that you\\'re not \"good enough\" is a pervasive one, and as I\\'ve formed bonds with Muslim sisters outside of my family, I\\'ve realized I\\'m not the only one who struggles with feeling caught between two worlds or who desperately wants to be accepted for who she is. Luckily, the support from the Muslim community for my book, and for me, has been heartening and wonderfully overwhelming. So, yes, I\\'m an all-American Muslim Girl. I know the lyrics to every Pearl Jam song, and I pray multiple times a day. I choose not to wear hijab, and I choose to eat as much of my Amto\\'s koosa as I can fit into my stomach when I\\'m home visiting family. Like my Muslim sisters, I am complex, and I am empowered and I adore my religion. I am enough, exactly as I am. © 2019 Cable News Network. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

       " 'Washington (CNN) - The US Defense Department Inspector General\\'s Office is declining to open an investigation into why military assistance to Ukraine was delayed by the Trump administration. The decision was made out of concern that such a probe could duplicate or interfere with the impeachment inquiry taking place in the House of Representatives, according to a letter sent to senators Wednesday. A spokesperson for the Defense Department inspector general confirmed that they had sent a letter to several top Democratic senators regarding the decision but noted that \"as circumstances evolve our decision could change.\" Democrats who had requested the review expressed their disappointment. \"We are disappointed that the Defense Department Office of the Inspector General has declined to investigate the Defense Department\\'s delay of the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative funding appropriated by Congress,\" Sen. Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, said in a statement. He and several other top Democrats had written to the acting inspector general in September asking him to investigate the delay, citing concerns that it \"would appear to have hindered the Department\\'s statutory obligation to provide security assistance to Ukraine at a critical moment, and raises serious questions about whether DoD officials were involved in any scheme to target a political opponent.\" \"As a result, it is imperative that your office pursue a thorough review of DoD\\'s potential role in these allegations, and provide your findings to the congressional defense committees in a timely manner,\" Durbin wrote in the letter to acting Inspector General Glenn Fine. News that the Trump administration had placed a hold on aid to Ukraine surfaced in late August, and the circumstances surrounding that decision have come under scrutiny as part of the House Democratic impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump. House Democrats conducting the impeachment probe have argued the President attempted to use the aid as leverage while pressing Ukraine to investigate domestic political rivals, evidence, they say, of a quid pro quo. The White House has offered shifting and vague accounts of why the hold was implemented and what triggered Trump to ultimately change course and release the money. What is clear, however, is that in the days leading up to Trump\\'s decision to unfreeze the aid, there was a confluence of significant events. National security adviser John Bolton was fired the day before the President released the aid, and White House officials had recently been made aware of a whistleblower complaint that had been filed concerning Trump\\'s behavior toward Ukraine. Administration officials have tried to pin the delay on government bureaucracy. They have pointed to reviews by national security agencies and another by the Office of Management and Budget to ensure the funds were well-spent. But detailed assessments had been conducted before the funds were frozen in June. And there\\'s little indication that any such process took place after the freeze. Laura Cooper, the Pentagon\\'s deputy assistant secretary for Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia, told lawmakers behind closed doors last month that she had met with then-US Special Envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker in August to discuss the hold on the aid. She said Volker had told her in their meeting that he was attempting to lift the hold by having the Ukrainians deliver a public statement that they would launch the investigations sought by Trump. A congressional watchdog group announced earlier this month that it is conducting a review to determine whether the Trump administration violated appropriations law by halting the funds. The Government Accountability Office initiated the review after Sen. Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat, asked the US comptroller whether the administration had violated the law by holding the funds until \"the very last moment\" and failing to notify Congress of the decision, according to the office\\'s spokesman Charles Young. © 2019 Cable News Network.

Follow him on Twitter @paulcallan. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. (CNN) - Prosecutors in serious criminal cases like to start strong and finish strong to bring home a guilty verdict. They have to grab the attention of the jury before defense attorneys sully the water. Former federal prosecutor and Harvard Law grad, House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff, successfully executed the first part of this strategy, making a compelling case against President Donald Trump in a carefully crafted and smoothly delivered opening statement. He successfully brushed aside an assortment of \"points of order\" and other parliamentary procedure stalling tactics which were employed by the minority Republicans to disrupt the flow of the proceedings. He also hinted at a surprise. The real case against President Trump may rest on \"abuse of power\" as charged in prior impeachment cases. This relates to the President\\'s defiance of congressional subpoenas and his willful refusal to cooperate with lawful congressional investigations. Such actions may violate the Constitution\\'s requirement of checks and balances between the three branches of government. After all, the founding fathers had just fought the Revolutionary War to curb tyranny and none of them wanted a tyrannical president. The abuse charge provides a good backup impeachment theory if the Ukraine allegations fail to resonate in the Republican-majority Senate. Republicans should fear that a tyrannical Trump may someday be followed by an equally tyrannical Democrat. Or maybe they enjoy being slapped around by the executive branch of government. Mr. Schiff also followed another rule employed by respected trial attorneys. They never \"overpromise.\" Schiff accomplished this task, delivering a non-inflammatory but carefully constructed explanation of how the President allegedly abused his power by using $400 million of American military aid to Ukraine as his own personal weapon in an attempt to destroy his political opponent, Joe Biden. Schiff then proceeded to swear in two witnesses who would testify together. They were US chargé d\\'affaires in Ukraine, Ambassador Bill Taylor, and Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs George Kent. Throughout the hearing, Kent remained relatively silent while Taylor, a gray-haired, distinguished diplomat right out of central casting did the heavy lifting. Taylor explained in somber but sometimes colorful detail the bizarre backdoor channel to Ukraine designed by Trump and his minister, without any portfolio whatsoever. Rudy Giuliani. The purpose of this back channel was to use Giuliani and a pair of Trump appointees rather than the so-called \"Deep State\" professional diplomats who Mr. Trump distrusts, to convey an ominous warning to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The message in substance: \"No Biden investigation, no $400 million in military aid.\" The announcement would be made in an interview on Trump\\'s most vilified network, CNN. Taylor\\'s testimony revealed that in visits to Ukraine\\'s Donbass front he was told that at least one or two Ukrainians were dying every day in a hot war with Russia for control of the Ukrainian coal production region. American aid was desperately needed, and delay meant death to Ukraine\\'s soldiers. The conclusion any reasonable person would draw from such testimony is that the President\\'s threats and the actual withholding of aid was aiding and abetting Russia. It was also causing the death of brave Ukrainians, American allies defending their homeland. All of this so Trump can beat Biden in the next presidential election. In some respects, it actually sounds far worse than Richard Nixon throwing a few dollars to the Watergate burglars and then elaborately covering it up. No one died as a result of Nixon\\'s theoretically impeachable offenses. In contrast, testimony on Day 1 of the House impeachment hearing suggested that American professional diplomats feared that Trump\\'s delay in the disbursement of Ukraine\\'s $400 million in military aid could telegraph a lack of American commitment, creating the real potential to cost the lives of Ukrainian soldiers by encouraging Russian aggression. Unfortunately for the Democrats, their case against the President began to fade as Republicans successfully muddied the water throughout the afternoon. They posed questions suggesting that any presidential effort to steer the Ukrainian criminal investigations were legitimate efforts to expose what they claimed was Ukrainian sabotage of the 2016 American presidential election, citing a theory that has been debunked. (Even a former Trump official has acknowledged it had no merit.) The Steele Dossier raised its ugly head, as did the prosecution of Paul Manafort. The Republican questions were designed to remind Americans of the perfectly legal and abundantly funded Mueller/Russia investigation which haunted the first half of the Trump presidency. And why was Hunter Biden reportedly being paid $50,000 a month by Ukraine\\'s largest energy company, Burisma, when he didn\\'t even reside in Ukraine or have an extensive background in the energy business? And why was his father constantly traveling to Ukraine and demanding the firing of a prosecutor investigating Burisma and maybe Hunter? Congressional questions require no supporting evidence, and none was provided. In fact, no evidence has surfaced of wrongdoing by Joe or Hunter Biden in this matter. The Republican point: If it was proper to spend millions of dollars to investigate Russian efforts to influence the American election, how can it be an impeachable offense to compel Ukrainian cooperation in an investigation of the very same subject. And if the investigations link to Biden corruption, all the better. Those carefully prepared and distinguished \"central casting\" diplomats Taylor and Kent started to look flustered and confused since they knew nothing about the unrelated topics that Republicans like Jim Jordan threw angrily into the conspiracy questions pot. Any real American courtroom would overrule his wandering conspiracy-themed questions as not relevant to the direct testimony of the witnesses or even within their knowledge. Courts also prohibit witness speculation. But this is Congress on television and not a court of law, and as congressional cross examination goes, Jordan did a great job in establishing that virtually all the evidence produced by Taylor and Kent was classic hearsay. Like Trump, he would be entertaining on\"The Apprentice,\" though as potential competition to Trump, he would soon be fired. There was one new testimonial nugget revealed at the first hearing. Taylor revealed that Tim Morrison, then a National Security Council official, allegedly learned of a conversation between the US Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland and the President, in which Trump insisted that Zelensky publicly announce that he was beginning investigations of \"Biden and 2016 election interference.\" This snippet is hearsay, and though Jordan and his Republican colleagues were happy to remind Schiff earlier in the day that the \"Federal Rules of Evidence\" do not apply to congressional hearings, this time they wanted the hearsay thrown out. Having no rules of evidence in place permitted Republicans to pontificate conspiracy theories in confusing speeches posing as questions. Such repeated conduct would lead to a contempt citation in any American courtroom. But the Republicans favor strict enforcement of the hearsay rule only when it helps their case. This enables them to say the information about a direct connection to Trump is \"inadmissible\" hearsay. Congressman Jordan should have a look at Federal Rule of Evidence 802. He will discover that the actual hearsay rule doesn\\'t apply to congressional hearings. The Sondland snippet is admissible as is most of the other testimony linking the President to the \"quid pro quo,\" which we will be hearing a lot more about as the hearings proceed. Or maybe it will all come down to multiple counts of abuse of power, but there is still a long and winding road to travel as the hearings continue. © 2019 Cable News Network.

       " '(CNN) - Three Democratic heavyweights this week have dangled the possibility of a 2020 White House run, a reflection of the extraordinarily unsettled nature of the Democratic field only a few months before voting begins. On the eve of the first public impeachment hearings, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg made a run to Arkansas on Tuesday to secure his spot on that state\\'s Democratic primary ballot, should he decide to run. Former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick weighed a late entry to the race while facing down Friday\\'s filing deadline in the key state of New Hampshire. And Hillary Clinton coyly suggested, once again, that she could leap from the sidelines. Clearly enjoying the opportunity to taunt Trump at this vulnerable moment in his presidency, and undoubtedly unnerving some current 2020 Democrats. Clinton told BBC Radio that she was not running for president in 2020, but she left the door ajar. \"Never say never, and I will certainly tell you I\\'m under enormous pressure from many, many, many people to think about it,\" Clinton told BBC radio in the midst of a publicity tour for her new book with her daughter, Chelsea. \"But as of this moment, sitting here in this studio talking to you, that is absolutely not in my plans.\" In Clinton\\'s case, teasing another White House bid was most likely a lighthearted way of drawing publicity for her new book. Last month, when Trump tweeted that \"Crooked Hillary Clinton\" should run again to \"steal it away from Uber Left Elizabeth Warren,\" the 2016 Democratic nominee playfully tweeted back: \"Don\\'t tempt me. Do your job.\" (CNN reported in October that Clinton\\'s admirers have tried to coax her off the sidelines, but she has repeatedly ruled out a run). Still, the fact that Patrick and Bloomberg could soon join the field underscores how fractured Democrats are three months before the opening contest in Iowa. The party still has not settled its long-running debate about whether to swing hard to the left by nominating a candidate like Warren, a senator from Massachusetts, or Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, both of whom have excited a younger generation of activists, or embrace a more moderate candidate who could theoretically appeal to Republicans and independents disenchanted by Trump, as well as blue-collar voters who the party lost to Trump in 2016. The latest polls in early-primary states demonstrate that lack of consensus among Democrats about who would be strongest against Trump, which has prompted much of the hand-wringing in recent months. A new Monmouth University poll of likely caucusgoers out Tuesday showed South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg surging to the top of the field with 22%, followed by Biden with 19%, Warren with 18% and Sanders at 13%. All four were within the margin of error, meaning that none of them could claim front-runner status in the Hawkeye State. (Bloomberg registered at 1%). Biden held a slender lead in New Hampshire in a new Quinnipiac University poll this week with the support of 20% of likely voters in the state. Warren followed at 16%, Buttigieg at 15% and Sanders at 14%. The glimmer of hope for Patrick and Bloomberg at this late stage is rooted in Democrats\\' uncertainty about Biden, who was perceived as a far stronger front-runner before he entered the race earlier this year. But both men are untested among the broader electorate. The filing deadlines to get on key state ballots this week appear to have forced the hand of Bloomberg and Patrick, who could face a major disadvantage if they miss the chance to compete in all 50 states, particularly if the race devolves into a prolonged delegate fight. Last week Bloomberg\\'s team filed the paperwork needed to get on the primary ballot in Alabama. (Patrick missed the deadlines in Alabama and appears to have missed Arkansas\\'). Bloomberg\\'s adviser Howard Wolfson told CNN in a statement last week that Bloomberg plans to skip the first four primary contests. \"If we run, we are confident we can win in states voting on Super Tuesday and beyond, where we will start on an even footing,\" Wolfson said. On Tuesday in Arkansas, Bloomberg told a gaggle of reporters he was \"still exploring what we\\'re going to do\" and deflected questions about Biden\\'s strength as a candidate, calling him \"a very nice guy.\" \"I\\'ve known him for a long time, and if you want to know about Joe Biden, you\\'ve got to talk to Joe Biden. He\\'s running his campaign, I\\'m running mine and one thing doesn\\'t necessarily have anything to do with another,\" Bloomberg told reporters. \"All I\\'ve got to do is, if I run, explain to people what I think is wrong with this country, and how I would fix it. And then the public can make a decision,\" the former New York mayor said. \"I\\'ve been more and more upset with what\\'s going on here,\" he said. \"We don\\'t talk to each other. We don\\'t work together. There\\'s a lack of honesty and civility. That is not good for our country, and I\\'ve got two daughters and two grandkids that I care about. And I\\'d like to do something about it, whether it\\'s running for president or something else.\" © 2019 Cable News Network. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

       " 'Washington (CNN) - Former Democratic presidential candidate Rep. Tim Ryan endorsed Joe Biden\\'s presidential bid Wednesday, saying the former vice president has the ability to win swing states President Donald Trump won in 2016. \"This election for many, many Democrats, regardless of where you live, is about who can beat Donald Trump. And the key to that is who can beat Donald Trump in Michigan, in Wisconsin, in Western Pennsylvania, in Ohio. And I\\'m convinced that that\\'s Joe Biden,\" Ryan, who represents Ohio, said on MSNBC. \"We\\'ve got to beat Donald Trump. And to me, it\\'s clear as you go round and round and think about all of these great candidates that that\\'s Joe Biden. And I\\'m going to support him, I\\'m going to do everything I can for him in the early states and in the Midwest to help him become the nominee and beat Donald Trump,\" he said. Ryan, who dropped his presidential bid in late October, said the remaining Democratic contenders are \"all good candidates,\" but argued that \"in Joe Biden\\'s bones is a connection to the working class people of this country\" and that he\\'s \"got the touch\" needed to \"bring some stability to the country.\" The endorsement could prove to be beneficial for the former vice president should he still be in the race when Ohio\\'s primary takes place in March. The state, which Trump carried by 8 percentage points in 2016, will be one of the closest-watched during next year\\'s election. Ryan had previously expressed misgivings about Biden\\'s candidacy, saying in September that he didn\\'t believe the former vice president has the stamina to beat Trump, Bloomberg reported. \"I just think Biden is declining. I don\\'t think he has the energy. You see it almost daily. And I love the guy,\" Ryan said during a phone call he had thought was with a donor, according to Bloomberg. The congressman did not walk back his comments later during an interview with CNN in which he pointed to Biden\\'s \"lack of clarity\" on issues and argued that Democrats need a candidate who \"can be very aggressive against Donald Trump\" and \"articulate a very clear vision for the country in a very forceful and firm way.\" During his own campaign, Ryan touted himself as a \"progressive who knows how to talk to working class people,\" and he hoped to convince once reliably Democratic voters that \"the progressive agenda is what is best for working families.\" But the Ohio Democrat\\'s campaign failed to gain any traction in a large field of better-financed and better-known Democrats, and he pulled out of the race, saying he would again run for his long-held House seat. Biden has so far received support from a number of other members of Congress, including Democratic Sens. Chris Coons and Tom Carper of Delaware, Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and Doug Jones of Alabama, as well as Democratic Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester of Delaware. © 2019 Cable News Network.

       " '(CNN) - Bill Taylor was everything Democrats hoped he would be. And everything Republicans feared he might be. Taylor, the top diplomat in Ukraine, was credible, serious, frank and deeply specific during his day-long testimony on Capitol Hill about his concerns regarding President Donald Trump\\'s behavior toward top Ukrainian officials. Taylor\\'s opening statement, which spanned better than a half hour, was a tour de force of damaging details for the President, culminating in a new revelation that an aide had overheard US Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland on the phone with the President on July 26 making clear that the Ukrainians were prepared to play ball. And that, when asked about Trump\\'s views on Ukraine, Sondland had told the aide that the President was primarily focused on getting investigations into Joe and Hunter Biden started. Democrats, led by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (California) largely just used their question time to allow Taylor to confirm and/or restate the timeline of events he laid out in scrupulous detail in his opening statement. How he first heard of the hold put on more than $400 million in US aid to Ukraine. How he realized that an \"irregular\" diplomatic channel, led by Trump personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, had been opened up with Ukraine. How it became increasingly clear to him that Trump and those close to the President were seeking to leverage the political power of the United States to pressure a foreign country to dig up dirt on a possible 2020 rival. Republicans on the committee did their best to disrupt the momentum that Taylor\\'s opening statement had created by noting that all of his concerns were based on things conveyed to him second- and third-hand, and that because nothing ever came of these asks from Trump, and Ukraine got the aid anyway, that this was all a big nothingburger. The GOP interrogators had limited success. Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan\\'s rapid-fire questioning strategy was probably the most effective, because Taylor simply would not be ruffled. He repeatedly told Republicans that he wasn\\'t there to make broad proclamations about whether the President deserved to be impeached or to speak for experiences from other people. He admitted there were things he didn\\'t know. He was candid and honest. In short: Taylor was deeply credible. Not just for what he said but for who he is, a lifelong diplomat appointed by presidents of both parties to senior diplomatic circles. At the top of his graduating class from the US Military Academy at West Point, and a decorated Vietnam veteran. Trump has, and will, accuse anyone who testifies in the House impeachment hearings as a \"Never Trumper\" or a member of the so-called \"deep state\" or worse. And there will be a decent chunk of his base that swallows those descriptions whole, facts be damned. But it\\'s very difficult to read Taylor\\'s opening statement, watch any of his testimony or scan his resume and believe that this accomplished but unassuming man is somehow motivated by his hatred of Trump rather than his love of country. This is someone with long and deep experience in diplomatic circles. Someone who has never been an irritant in the past. And someone who was deeply affected by what he saw and heard around that July 25 phone call. So, when Taylor said Wednesday that he had never, in his career, seen this sort of blatant attempt to use the power of the presidency for personal political gain, it meant something. And nothing good for Trump. © 2019 Cable News Network. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Listen to CNN (low-bandwidth usage). Go to the full CNN experience.',\n",
       " 'Washington (CNN) - Thirty-eight minutes into his opening statement during Wednesday\\'s impeachment hearing, Amb. Bill Taylor, the career foreign service officer and top US diplomat to Ukraine, paused, took a drink of water, and delivered the day\\'s biggest bombshell. Less than a week earlier, Taylor learned that a member of his staff had overheard President Donald Trump discussing \"the investigations\" in Ukraine while on the phone with EU ambassador Gordon Sondland. That newly disclosed call took place on July 26, one day after the now infamous call between Trump and new Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky. \"The member of my staff could hear President Trump on the phone, asking Ambassador Sondland about \\'the investigations.\\' Ambassador Sondland told President Trump that the Ukrainians were ready to move forward,\" Taylor testified. He also said that after the call, the staffer asked Sondland what Trump thought about Ukraine. Sondland apparently told the staffer that Trump \"cares more about the investigations\" of Joe Biden. To Democrats, the news was a revelation, one that directly ties the President to the proposed quid pro quo with the Ukrainians. But for Republicans, Taylor\\'s story was just more of the same, a second-hand account of conversations about other conversations that prove nothing except that the President\\'s opponents will use anything to get rid of him. The divergent reactions illustrate the gaping divide between Republicans and Democrats on impeachment. Democrats crowed over how clear the evidence is, while Republicans were left wondering what all the fuss is about. After the first day of televised impeachment testimony, the political battle lines had not moved an inch. A civil start to public hearings. For a hearing featuring two relatively unknown senior diplomats, the hype surrounding it was unmatched. Limited seating inside the Capitol Hill hearing room pushed would-be observers into the hallways outside. The voices of Democratic chairman Rep. Adam Schiff and ranking Republican Rep. Devin Nunes bounced around the crowded corridor as people watched the proceedings on their phones. But despite some expectations for an ugly partisan fight, Wednesday\\'s hearing did not dissolve into much bomb-throwing or political stunts. A trio of posters behind some of the Republican members that suggested the Democratic majority was being unfair (\"93 Days Since Adam Schiff Learned The Identity of the Whistleblower\" read one) got relatively little exposure on the TV cameras. A handful of parliamentary inquiries from Republican members early on interrupted the proceedings, but only temporarily. There were no protests, no repeat, for instance, of the storming of a closed-door hearing last month by a group of Republican House members. Democratic Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi told reporters afterward that he was surprised with how civil it ended up being. \"I\\'ve been to other hearings where my colleagues on the other side kind of jump up and down and they make a circus out of some of these proceedings. So I was a little concerned, but I was pleasantly surprised with the tone and the tenor and dignity of the hearing,\" Krishnamoorthi said. \\'Stunning\\' or \\'secondhand\\'. From the outset, Democrats seized on Taylor\\'s story, with Rep. Adam Schiff using his time for questions to have the ambassador repeat its details. In a post-hearing press conference, flanked by several somber-looking Democrats, Schiff said the details of the phone call speak for themselves. \"What this call indicates as other testimony has likewise indicated is that the instructions are coming from the President on down,\" said Schiff, who added that the committee has already moved to depose Taylor\\'s staff member. Other Democratic members of the committee zeroed in on Taylor\\'s new testimony. \"That was stunning news that just showed the intense engagement by the President in the investigations,\" Rep. Peter Welch told reporters. \"Donald Trump was even more involved than we even thought before,\" he said. For Republicans, however, it was as if Taylor\\'s big reveal never happened. None of them asked Taylor substantive questions about the Sondland-Trump phone call, and after the hearing dismissed its importance. \"I think it\\'s secondhand,\" said Rep. Chris Stewart, a Republican member of the committee, when asked about the phone call. \"I don\\'t know how in the world this person can claim listening to a conversation when the guy\\'s got the phone pressed to his ear.\" When asked about the call later that day during a press conference with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, President Trump said he knew, \"nothing about that.\" The President also dismissed Taylor\\'s testimony as \"more secondhand information.\" Dismissing the \\'star witness\\'. Rep. Jim Jordan, a recent GOP addition to the Intelligence committee, led the most aggressive questioning on Wednesday. A close ally of Trump\\'s, Jordan laid out a case that Taylor\\'s testimony relies on several levels of hearsay. Reading from a recent addendum to Sondland\\'s testimony, Jordan mocked the convoluted lines of communication supporting Taylor\\'s claim that it a quid pro quo was \"clear.\" \"\\'Ambassador Taylor recalls that Mr. Morrison told Ambassador Taylor that I told Mr. Morrison that I conveyed this message to Mr. Yermak on September 1, 2019 in connection to Vice President Pence\\'s visit to Warsaw and a meeting with President Zelensky.\\' We got six people having four conversations in one sentence, and you just told me this is where you got your clear understanding,\" Jordan said. \"And you\\'re their star witness? \"That Jordan moment was big,\" one House Republican aide told CNN. \"Hammers home our message in a nutshell and, for all the noise, distilling that was key.\" At a post-hearing press conference, Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik summed up the GOP argument against impeachment. \"The key facts here are as follows— One, Ukraine got the aid. Two, there was no investigation into the Bidens,\" she said. \"Those facts speak for themselves.\" Will anyone change their mind. At the beginning of what will be several more weeks of hearings, arguments, and debate on Capitol Hill, it\\'s anyone\\'s guess where the public will land when it\\'s all said and done. \"You know I\\'ve been saying for a couple weeks there isn\\'t much drama there. There aren\\'t any bombshells. And it\\'s probably not going to change anyone\\'s mind,\" said Republican Rep. Chris Stewart. Rep. Mike Quigley, a Democrat on the committee, was cautiously optimistic the hearing moved the ball forward with the American people. \"It\\'s a process. Give it time,\" Quigley told CNN. \"Wait till they hear the complete story. They do have a lot of the information before them in the public domain.\" The leaders in both parties were more insistent Wednesday was a good day for their agenda. Schiff noted that Republicans didn\\'t try to contest many of the facts offered by the witnesses. \"I think most people watching today probably thought at the end of this \\'I should be the one deciding who the President\\'s going to be and not some unelected bureaucrat in Washington, or Adam Schiff or Nancy Pelosi,\\'\" said Rep. Steve Scalise, the Republican whip. But what about Senate Republicans, who hold the majority and could help determine whether an impeached President Trump is convicted or acquitted? One GOP aide said that while the TVs in Senate offices were tuned to the hearing, it was unlikely many were paying close attention,. \"There\\'s a low, single-digit number of senators who think they are undecided,\" said the aide. © 2019 Cable News Network.

       " '(CNN) - Three suspects were seen walking near the home of a California tech executive with a rifle and a duffel bag minutes before police believe he was kidnapped and later killed, newly released surveillance video shows. The suspects are seen walking out of an alley onto the street where Tushar Atre lived, according to the video posted Wednesday by the Santa Cruz County Sheriff\\'s Office. Atre was the founder and CEO of AtreNet, a web marketing and design company, CNN affiliate KPIX reported. He was reportedly kidnapped last month and his body was found later that day in his car. \"We are asking for the public\\'s help in identifying the suspects seen in the video,\" Santa Cruz County Sheriff\\'s Office posted on Facebook Wednesday. \"The reward has been increased to $150,000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the people responsible for the crimes.\" Atre, 50, was last seen getting into his 2008 BMW SUV, the sheriff\\'s office said. A friend of Atre\\'s said he was taken around 3 a.m. on October 1 after someone broke into his house, according to KPIX. \"(W)e have no idea why, we have no idea who,\" the friend, Christopher Lochhead, wrote on Facebook, the station reported. \"We need everybody all of our friends the entire community to get behind this effort and support our sheriffs department and the FBI and law enforcement in finding Tushar,\" Lochhead said in the post, which has since been removed. Hours later, Santa Cruz Sheriff\\'s deputies said on Facebook the BMW was found with a body in it. They later identified the body as Atre, the founder and CEO of AtreNet, a web marketing and design company, according to KPIX. Contacted by CNN, Lochhead said friends and family of the kidnapped man have no comment and referred questions to the sheriff\\'s office. © 2019 Cable News Network. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.

       " '(CNN) - Former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick is telling friends and allies in phone calls on Wednesday that he has made a decision to run for president, two people familiar with the matter say. Plans for the timing of his formal announcement are still in flux, with attention on impeachment, but Patrick is likely to reveal his bid for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination by video or social media message on Thursday, with a formal appearance in New Hampshire on Friday to file his papers for the primary there with the secretary of state\\'s office, one person familiar with the plan says. The odds could be incredibly steep for a late entrant like Patrick, who is not well known nationally and does not have personal wealth to finance a campaign. Patrick has missed the deadline to appear on the primary ballot in Alabama and Arkansas. The deadline to file in New Hampshire is Friday. Patrick could seize upon potential advantages in early-voting states: He is from Massachusetts, which is next door to New Hampshire, home of the first-in-the-nation primary. And being one of the country\\'s first African American governors could be politically beneficial in South Carolina, where a majority of Democratic primary voters are black. CNN reported on Monday that Patrick was seriously weighing whether he could make a credible last-minute entry into the Democratic Party\\'s crowded primary contest after previously ruling out a bid late last year. The conversations began before former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg stepped forward last week to tease a possible run. Patrick told friends he regrets not moving forward with a 2020 campaign earlier this year and was trying to determine if it would still be possible. His considerations were first reported Monday by The New York Times. Last year, Patrick had built a small but formidable team of advisers in Boston as he planned a 2020 bid and had the backing of some top aides from President Barack Obama\\'s 2008 and 2012 campaigns. But he publicly ruled out a presidential bid nearly a year ago, citing the \"cruelty of our elections process.\" He wrote in a December Facebook post: \"After a lot of conversation, reflection and prayer, I\\'ve decided that a 2020 campaign for president is not for me. I\\'ve been overwhelmed by advice and encouragement from people from all over the country, known and unknown.\" \"But knowing that the cruelty of our elections process would ultimately splash back on people whom Diane and I love, but who hadn\\'t signed up for the journey, was more than I could ask,\" he wrote. Patrick told WBUR at the time that his wife, Diane, had recently been diagnosed with uterine cancer and had surgery right before Thanksgiving last year. He cited it as something that caused him to carefully consider whether he wanted to put his family though months of grueling campaigning. Patrick entered the private sector in 2015 and took a job at Bain Capital, the Boston-based private investment firm that became a liability to the 2012 presidential run of Republican Mitt Romney, another former Massachusetts governor and now a US senator from Utah. Patrick\\'s work at the firm, which was co-founded by Romney, could be a liability if he seeks the Democratic nomination, as he would be entering a race where frontrunner Democrats have cast wealthy and powerful interests as the enemy of progressive policies. Patrick last year defended his work at Bain Capital, telling CNN: \"I\\'ve never taken a job where I\\'ve left my conscience at the door, and I haven\\'t started now.\" Patrick had upped his political involvement ahead of the 2018 midterms, endorsing candidates in South Carolina, Texas, New Jersey and a handful of other states, leading many to believe he was going to jump into the race. © 2019 Cable News Network.

       " '(CNN) - Cigarette smoking among US adults fell to its lowest recorded level in 2018: 13.7%, according to a report published Thursday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That represents a drop of roughly two-thirds since the CDC started collecting this data in 1965. \"This marked decline in cigarette smoking is the achievement of a consistent and coordinated effort by the public health community and our many partners,\" the agency\\'s director, Dr. Robert R. Redfield, said in a statement Thursday. \"Yet, our work is far from over.\" The report estimated that 49.1 million US adults, or nearly 1 in 5, used any tobacco product in 2018. Cigarettes were the most common at 13.7%, followed by cigars, cigarillos and little filtered cigars, which were used by 3.9% of adults. E-cigarettes were the third most common tobacco product used by adults, at 3.2%. Their use rose from 2.8% in 2017, despite having been on the decline for several years prior. This was attributed partly to increases in vaping among young adults 18 to 24, which jumped from 5.2% in 2017 to 7.6% in 2018. Those who were most likely to use tobacco products were between 25 and 44; members of certain minority groups, including lesbian, gay and bisexual adults; those living with a disability or serious psychological distress; people in the Midwest or South; and adults making less than $35,000 per year. The report also found that cigarette smokers have become more likely to try quitting in the previous 12 months, and they have been more successful at doing so. © 2019 Cable News Network.

       " '(CNN) - The impeachment inquiry centers on claims that President Donald Trump used US tax dollars as bait to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to open investigations that could damage former Vice President Joe Biden heading into the 2020 election. Below are the key dates in the Democratic case. For more, here\\'s a detailed timeline. April 21. Zelensky is elected in Ukraine. Zelensky, a comedian and actor who previously played the President of Ukraine on TV, wins a landslide victory to become the actual President of Ukraine. Ukraine, which is in the midst of a war with Russian-led forces, badly needs US and other Western aid, and Zelensky quickly seeks a meeting with US President Donald Trump. May 1. Rudy Giuliani\\'s theory goes mainstream. The New York Times publishes a report on Hunter Biden and the Ukrainian company Burisma, which had placed him on its board while his father was still US vice president. Trump\\'s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani has been pushing for Ukrainians to investigate the arrangement and met repeatedly with Ukrainian Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko in New York, according to the report, which also notes Giuliani has talked about his theories with Trump. July 10. White House meeting between US and Ukrainian officials. This meeting has emerged as a key moment because it represents the first time it was clear that members of the administration were requiring a quid pro quo for Trump meeting with Zelensky, according to people giving testimony to the impeachment inquiry. The meeting featured White House and State Department officials as well as top officials in the Ukrainian government. Testimony suggests the decision was coordinated with acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, who would in October publicly acknowledge that aid was contingent on investigations, though he later denied it was a quid pro quo. Fiona Hill, a National Security Council Russia expert, testified that the suggestion alarmed then-national security adviser John Bolton, who \"immediately stiffened\" and ended the meeting. Separately, top National Security Council expert on Ukraine Alexander Vindman testified that Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland characterized the request for investigations by Ukraine as a \"deliverable\", and coordinated with Mulvaney, according to the transcript of his testimony. Before July 25. Aid to Ukraine frozen. The exact date remains unclear, but the White House Office of Management and Budget put on hold aid that Congress had directed to be sent to Ukraine. Laura Cooper, a Pentagon official in charge of Russia and Ukraine, testified that the first questions were raised by the White House about the status of the aid in mid-June. July 25. Phone call between Trump and Zelensky. Trump and Zelensky talk by phone, officially so that Trump can congratulate Zelensky on successful parliamentary elections. Trump repeatedly brings up investigations he\\'d like Zelensky to look into, including of interference in the 2016 election and the relationship between Burisma and the Bidens. Read an annotated transcript of the call. A readout of the call between Trump and Zelensky posted on the official website of the President of Ukraine includes a note that \"Donald Trump is convinced that the new Ukrainian government will be able to quickly improve image of Ukraine, complete investigation of corruption cases, which inhibited the interaction between Ukraine and the USA.\" The call triggers immediate concerns in the White House, including on the part of Vindman, who listened in. The transcript of the call is placed in a more secure server. July 26. Diplomats meet with Zelensky; Trump asks Sondland about investigations. US Special Envoy for Ukraine Kurt Volker, accompanied by Sondland, meets with Zelensky in Kiev. They discuss military topics, according to Zelensky\\'s statement after the meeting, which does not mention the corruption investigations. Volker and Sondland reportedly advise the Ukrainian leadership on how to \"navigate\" Trump\\'s demands of Zelensky, according to the later whistleblower complaint. An aide to Bill Taylor, the top US diplomat in Ukraine, overhears a phone call between Trump and Sondland in which Trump asks about the investigations, according to Taylor\\'s later testimony. Separately, Pentagon aides, according to the Cooper testimony, realize the holdup in aid is directly related to Trump\\'s concerns about Ukraine and begin trying to legally justify holding the aid, which had been allocated by Congress. August 1. Giuliani meets Ukrainian official. Following up on Trump\\'s request to Zelensky, Giuliani and Zelensky\\'s aide Andriy Yermak meet in Madrid, according to Giuliani. August 12. Whistleblower files complaint. This document will eventually trigger the impeachment inquiry. Read an annotated version. August 29. Ukraine raises concerns about the aid. According to Taylor\\'s testimony, he speaks on the phone with Yermak, who is alarmed about the status of the aid. Yermak separately texts Volker a Politico story on the withheld aid. September 1. Sondland delivers ultimatum; Taylor raises concerns about Ukraine aid. Sondland recalls telling Yermak, on the sidelines of a meeting between Vice President Mike Pence and Zelensky in Warsaw, that there would be no aid without the investigations. Separately, Taylor texts Sondland and asks if security assistance, and not just a White House meeting, is conditioned on the investigations. In a subsequent phone call, Sondland, says Taylor, makes clear that everything is going to be withheld because Trump wants to put the Ukrainians in a \"public box\" and force the investigations on them. September 9. Concerns from Taylor and the inspector general come to a head. In text messages and in a phone call with Sondland, Taylor raises more concerns about holding the Ukraine aid. Intelligence community Inspector General Michael Atkinson notifies House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff and ranking member Rep. Devin Nunes of an \"urgent concern\", the whistleblower complaint, that acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire has not allowed him to forward to Congress as required by law. Three House committees launch an investigation of efforts by Trump, Giuliani and others to pressure the Ukrainian government to assist the President\\'s reelection efforts and the committees request information about Trump\\'s July 25 phone call with Zelensky. September 11. White House lifts freeze on Ukraine aid. The White House lifted its temporary hold on $391 million in military and security assistance for Ukraine, according to testimony from key witnesses. September 12. Ukraine informed hold on military aid is lifted. Taylor tells Zelensky that the hold on the military aid is lifted and says it is key to not get involved in foreign elections. An interview scheduled for the next day with CNN\\'s Fareed Zakaria is canceled. September 24. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announces a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump. The day before the transcript of Trump\\'s call with Zelensky is released and two days before the whistleblower complaint is made public, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announces in a televised address that existing House oversight investigations into Trump will be expanded into an impeachment inquiry.

       " '(CNN) - Program notes: Tune in to CNN\\'s \"The Lead\" with Jake Tapper at 4 p.m. ET for more on this story. As the first public impeachment hearing in more than two decades aired Wednesday, Americans watched the spectacle unfold with curiosity, skepticism and a measure of dismay about just how deeply divided this nation has become. Heading into proceedings that will span at least 10 days, House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff did his best to make the \"giant show,\" as one Wisconsin voter called it, play out like a serious courtroom procedural with time equally split between the two parties. But the undertone of anger from GOP leaders like Reps. Jim Jordan and Devin Nunes underscored that Americans are living in a political universe where no one seems to share the same version of the truth. Trump supporter Kent Jeffers from Cedar Grove, Wisconsin, who was keeping an eye on the hearing during a trip to Phoenix, highlighted the depth of the Democratic challenge by pointing to the numbness many Americans feel after three consecutive years of investigations into President Donald Trump. \"Mueller didn\\'t get him,\" Jeffers said, referring to the investigation into Trump\\'s dealings with Russia by Special Counsel Robert Mueller. \"Other people didn\\'t get him. Now we need to find another narrative. I think everyone\\'s numb to it. I think they\\'re just done with it. It\\'s kind of a joke now, same thing over and over again. You\\'re not going to change my mind with coming up with a new narrative to get him out of office.\" Boyce O\\'Brien of Phoenix, who voted GOP every election until Trump, lamented what he views as the lack of a moral compass among elected officials within the President\\'s party, and the likelihood that impeachment could just become another partisan exercise. \"Where are those Christian Republicans when it comes to integrity? They\\'ve ignored what this president has done,\" O\\'Brien said. \"This is another example of it. I hope this (the hearing) will turn the tide and hold him accountable. These hearings are hopefully a turning point for the country. Let\\'s hope it goes to integrity, accountability, to the rule of law.\" It remains an open question whether the disclosures of the next 10 days, and the public retelling of the story of how Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate his political rival, will move the needle of public opinion, which has recently stagnated on impeachment. Some independents like David Cronin from Arizona, where the party registration is a third Democrat, a third Republican and a third independent, said he hoped the hearings would lay out the facts unfiltered. \"You have people on both sides who are not budging. Then you have people in the middle, like myself,\" Cronin said. \"I think they\\'re important for the American people to see. It doesn\\'t pass the sniff test,\" he added of the President\\'s conduct. \"I say that as an independent, middle of the road, who could vote Democrat or Republican.\" In the critical swing state of New Hampshire, where independents compromise a large part of the electorate, some voters wondered how closely the American people would pay attention to a recitation of complex diplomatic dealings involving military aid to a foreign power. \"It\\'s dry. No matter what you do to it, it\\'s dry,\" said Ralph Mecheau from Bow, New Hampshire, who also tuned in to the Watergate hearings decades ago. \"It\\'s point, counterpoint, point, counterpoint. I don\\'t think it\\'s going to change anybody\\'s minds.\" \"I think the guy, quite frankly, is treasonous,\" Mecheau said, referring to Trump. \"So nothing the opposition is going to say is going to change my mind on that.\" But he said he believed there were enough people throughout America who feel buyer\\'s remorse with Trump to turn him out of office in 2020. \"Right here we have a real reformer,\" said Mecheau, who works for the state\\'s liquor commission and is a union member, after attending an Elizabeth Warren event Wednesday night, adding, \"we have another one in Bernie\" Sanders. \"They are true reformers. You can see who their enemies are; you can see who the money is,\" Mecheau said, referring to the money behind their candidacies. \"Every time the money says they are going to put somebody in like (former New York Mayor Michael) Bloomberg. basically they\\'re giving me a harder endorsement on her or Bernie. We need people that are true reformers. That is what started to happen, and people wanted in 2016. They just chose the wrong reformer.\" In another critical swing state. Wisconsin. Trump voters Randy and Terri Burl tuned in to the hearings even though they don\\'t expect to their opinions to change much, if at all. \"It\\'s just like a person who watches a soap opera. It\\'s bad acting and all that,\" said Randy Burl who watched the hearings with his wife, who is the chair of the Forest County Wisconsin Republican Party. Terri Burl said she is convinced that the President did nothing wrong. \"I want Trump to be Trump. If he started acting presidential tomorrow, and he started sounding like George W. Bush, I\\'d be like \\'What happened?\\' Because he\\'s going to say things that are true even if it hurts people\\'s feelings.\" After watching several hours of the proceedings, Randy Burl, who is a less enthusiastic supporter of the President, told his wife he wasn\\'t as convinced of Trump\\'s innocence, but he was skeptical that impeachment would change many minds about the commander in chief. \"If he is found guilty or not guilty, or he\\'s impeached or not, I just don\\'t see it having a dramatic effect,\" Burl said. \"Most working people are never going to see these hearings. They\\'re going to turn on their new show that supports whatever party they like and read their spin on it.\" © 2019 Cable News Network. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

       " 'Washington (CNN) - In its effort to sell off the lease to the Trump International Hotel in Washington the Trump Organization has put together a glossy investor brochure complete with pictures showcasing the hotel\\'s grandiose architecture, its central location and its spa\\'s Himalayan salt chamber. The hotel\\'s biggest selling point though, according to a copy of the brochure seen by CNN, is the one thing that the Trump family insists it didn\\'t take advantage of: profiting off foreign governments. \"Tremendous upside potential exists for a new owner to fully capitalize on government related business upon rebranding of the asset,\" reads the 46-page investor pitch. The Trump Organization insists that its refusal to solicit foreign business has cost it more than $9 million. According to the brochure, those \"sacrifices\" include turning away 17,100 room nights in 2019, resulting in $5.3 million in lost room revenue and $3.9 million in lost food and beverage revenue. The investor pitch is an explicit acknowledgment of how important foreign business is to the 263-room luxury hotel in the Old Post Office building blocks from the White House. Though it includes specific numbers of how much money it turned away from foreign governments, the pitch does not include figures for how much the hotel has accepted, despite reports showing it has become a magnet for foreign officials. Nor does it provide actual or historical financial performance data for the hotel, which is named in multiple lawsuits accusing Trump of using the property to illegally profit off his presidency. Those lawsuits claim Trump has violated the emoluments clause of the US Constitution, which forbids the President from receiving gifts or payments from foreign governments. In its defense, the Trump Organization says that it has voluntarily donated over $340,000 in income it has received from foreign governments to the US Treasury in 2017 and 2018. The President\\'s lawyers have also argued that since his assets have been placed into a trust, he does not directly benefit from the hotel\\'s business. Instead the materials offer financial projections for years 2020 to 2026 based on a sales and marketing strategy targeting foreign governments. Trump previously reported in his financial disclosure form that the hotel made $40.8 million in revenues in 2018 and $40.4 million in 2017. The family has never disclosed whether the hotel is profitable. The Trump Organization did not respond to CNN\\'s requests for comment. Projected jump in revenue. Nevertheless the company is projecting a whopping 65% jump in revenue from 2018 to 2020. According to the investor pitch, the hotel is estimated to have operating revenues of $67.7 million next year, and $6 million in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization minus expenses to keep the hotel updated. JLL Hotels & Hospitality, the real estate company hired to sell the hotel lease, projects the occupancy rate at the Washington hotel next year will hit 68.3%. That\\'s below other five-star hotels in the area, which JLL estimates will have 74.5% occupancy rates, according to the investor brief. The investor pitch began circulating in recent weeks after the Trump Organization announced last month that it was exploring the sale of its 60-year lease with the General Services Administration. After signing the lease in 2013, the Trump Organization poured millions of dollars into revamping the Old Post Office building, and opened its doors in October 2016, less than two weeks before Trump won the election. \"People are objecting to us making so much money on the hotel, and therefore we may be willing to sell,\" Eric Trump said in a statement last month. When Trump became President he did not sell off his assets as previous presidents have, but put the family business into a trust delegating the running of the family business to his two sons, Eric and Don Jr, and other executives. $500 million selling price. A person familiar with the matter told the Wall Street Journal that the company is hoping to get more than $500 million for the property, or about $2 million per room key (the sales price divided by the number of rooms), which would be one of the highest prices ever paid for a hotel in Washington. By contrast the Rosewood Hotel, a luxury five-star property in Georgetown, sold for $1.3 million a room key in 2016. \"It\\'s an extremely high price but the location and the recent renovation of the hotel are going to command a historic value for the Washington, DC, area,\" said Dan Hawkins, a senior director in hotels and hospitality group of Berkadia, a commercial real estate firm. A sale is not without complications. The buyer won\\'t own the land since it\\'s leased from GSA, which would also have to approve the sale. The arrangement also raises possible conflicts of interest since Trump is effectively on both sides of the transaction as the seller and the boss of the GSA officials charged with approving a deal. Some potential buyers have questioned why Trump wouldn\\'t wait until he leaves office to sell the property to avoid debate over whether he sought to benefit from his office. Others have raised ethical concerns that it is overpriced and being marketed to deep pocketed foreign buyers, who may be motivated to curry favor with the President. When Trump created the trust for his business he also named as ethics adviser Bobby Burchfield, a Washington lawyer, who would have to approve certain transactions, including a sale of the hotel. Under the ethics review, Trump is not permitted to sell to a sovereign wealth fund or to a foreign government. A foreign citizen however would not be immediately disqualified from buying the hotel. The transaction also has to be determined to be a fair market value with no indication that the counterpart is trying to influence the Trump administration or extract a concession. Despite the Trump Organization\\'s claims that it turned away millions of dollars in business from foreign governments, the Washington hotel has done brisk business with them. Delegations from Saudi Arabia, Malaysia and Kuwait have stayed at the hotel or held events there, along with members of Trump\\'s cabinet and GOP fundraisers. The Prime Minister of Romania reportedly booked a room earlier this year. Foreign business is not the only selling point the Trump Organization is highlighting to possible buyers.
